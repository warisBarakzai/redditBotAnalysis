As a Canadian it always blows my kind whenever I read the debate about healthcare in America. I want to share my experience with appendicitis that happened about a month ago. Woke up in terrible pain in my lower right side called telehealth (free Ontario nurses who can help diagnose you) and was told to go for the ER. Went there got registered as a patient and it took about 6hrs for me to be diagnosed (scans blood urine results). I was in surgery within an hour. They kept me over night. I was told I could leave about 24hr after I arrived there the previous day. The only papers I was given were post surgery advice and couple signatures before surgery for liability reasons. Paid $15 for pain medication at the pharmacy. No bills. ,0
To everyone complaining about their taxes going up or whatever you never know when something catastrophic could happen to you or your family.My dad was a healthy 45 year old who one day got a sinus infection that turned into bronchitis that turned into asthma/COPV and some mystery illness. He stayed sick for 15 years until he died.After a couple of years he had to quit his job because he worked with the public and he couldn't stand the smell of women's perfume without having an asthma attack the kind that would send you to the ER.So we lost half of our income while our medical bills went through the roof; we were going to the ER at least twice a month sometimes staying in ICU. Between the hospital visits doctor visits and prescription drug costs we almost lost our house and went bankrupt. Both my mom and my dad just had basic jobs that didn't require a college degree.This practically happened overnight. The doctors never figured out what the mystery illness was but my dad was too sick to go to his own mother's funeral.Granted this was before the ACA so I don't know how that would have changed things but we had my mom's insurance and still almost lost everything. Only family stepping in and helping with groceries and bills saved us.It was a nightmare. Something has to change.,0
>that same survey found that when respondents were told that a universal healthcare plan might give the government ã¢too much controlã¢ or that it might increases taxes opposition spiked from 43% to 62% and 60% respectively ã¢_ perhaps a sign of the major political and policy fights that lie aheadI'm continually amazed and disappointed at how many people have been conditioned to believe that government administration is inherently tyrannical. In the case of healthcare it's not the *government* which makes it tyrannical it's the *profit motive*. The government isn't going to screw people and deny services so some bigwigs can make a fortune. But insurance companies *will*.,1
When it comes to bills like this there will always be compromise. Why do you think Obamacare became washed down socialized health care? Even in the hypothetical future the Dems will still need some R support for an eventual healthcare bill. Bills this large cant get by without at least some level of bipartisanship. Some of the stuff in this bill simply will not ever be signed off on by the GOP. Even if the GOP sides with public opinion on Universal Healthcare some time in the future I cant see them folding on their tax philosophy. Thats why I feel arguably the most controversial aspect of this bill is the tax hike on people making over 250k.  ,1
Why do people get excited about the tax cost Medicare for All would impose? Do people not realize that their insurance premiums are just as much if not more than a MFA tax? Right now I have a shitty HSA for my son and I and that still costs me $180 per check and I basically have nothing to show for it but catastrophic coverage. I pay everything else out of pocket until I hit my $5k deductible. I could pay about 10-15% in MFA taxes end up at my same take home pay AND I WOULD HAVE VASTLY BETTER INSURANCE COVERAGE.I have fucked up shoulders that need help but I'm not able to afford the out of pocket costs or the MRI and subsequent PT/surg I would need in order to fix my shoulders. It's so fucked that I along with basically all other Americans can't go and get the help we need because it's simply too expensive. AND THAT'S WITH INSURANCE!!!We need to get the fuck off private insurance and begging a ground to ceiling medical reform initiative in this country. Our medical access is fucking garbage. ,0
I think this has to be the end goal but even as someone who believes that and who loves Bernie I think Murphy's plan might be the better option for right now. It's essentially a public option allowing people to buy into Medicare (likely for cheaper than most private options). The hope would be that as more and more people just move to Medicare on their own and like it it makes single payer much easier to sell. Plus shouldn't be much reason for republicans to oppose it - they always claim to be about choice and options this is just another option.The obvious downside is it doesn't get us to full coverage until however long it takes to eventually transitition to single payer and that's an issue. I haven't yet read Bernie's bill but I've read a couple summaries and both said it's vague on how it will be paid for which I kind of expected. ,0
This needs to happen. My daughter just got out of the hospital (she is doing well - not looking for sympathy). It was a children's hospital and it was a soul crushing experience. Not just because of what my teen daughter had to go through but seeing and hearing these kids some of them tiny babies in such pain. We are lucky I have great insurance. I pay $1000.00 a month for it but luckily I can afford that. We were in the hospital for about 3 weeks I saw many families come and go and found myself wondering how many of them would experience the relief of having their child well again dampened by the depression of having astronomical bills that they can't afford. That shouldn't happen in the richest country in history. It is criminal.,0

"The country is still much better off accepting the fact that today far more people like the PPACA then they did when it was passed.  The very foundation of it is Republican in concept (Heritage Foundation).Single Payer is never going to really work because the government grossly overpays for everything it buys. Moreover this is a country that can't properly take care of their own veterans...what makes ANYONE think they can take care of everyone?The reality for me is Republicans need to accept the reality that ""Obamacare"" is a far better solution than Trumpcare (which would send tens of millions to uninsured - ergo just recreating the problem we had before Obamacare) and it's far better than expecting the government to accurately provide health care for 320 million people.  Having the government actively oversee and coordinate private industry insurers....putting reasonable price controls in place and providing need based credits so EVERYONE is insured by private industry is the most efficient solution to the problem.  The PPACA needs significant repairs but the guts of it are the best compromise solution there is.Unfortunately neither side gets it.",0
"Some easy ways to cut other costs to help pay for such a system:    - Cut insane military spending. So much of what we spend tax dollars on is bloated obsolete overkill nonsense leftover from the WWII/Cold War era. How many nuclear missiles do we really need? Bombers? Fighter jets? And so on. It's absurd.   - End the ""war on drugs"" (I seem to recall that we learned at some point in the past that prohibition does not work) and tax and regulate the various banned substances that costs us a ton in policing and imprisonment. I'd rather my tax dollars be spent on improving the health and happiness of myself and my fellow citizens than on either of those two harmful and outrageously expensive endeavors. ",0
Though I respect and completely agree with Senator Sanders in that United States NEEDS universal healthcare.  It is long overdue it is something that is workable in real life and not modeled in a computer simulation.  There are plenty of Countries in which to study how it is applied and administered in their Country.  Canada comes to mind.That being said this sub is sounding more and more an echo chamber with nobody chiming in playing the devils advocate.  There is a lot of hard work and a long rough road that lie ahead but this needs to be debated openly and discussed with respect.  We need to populate this discussion with others with opposite opinion that make a compelling argument for their side.,1
If Democrats want to win here's what I think might work:1) Universal healthcare yes... but also:  2) More restrictive immigration controls. People would be more ready to buy into Democrat wealth redistribution programs if Democrats didn't also support bringing more low-skilled workers into the country.  3) A rethink of welfare when it comes to what it incentivizes people to do. Put forward some ideas for how to continue providing welfare but in such a way that it discourages welfare recipients from having kids.  4) Less emphasis on gun control. Law-abiding gun owners don't want to be punished for what law-breaking gun owners do.  5) Get tougher on violent crime but without increased police authoritarianism. Democrats have a tendency to make too many excuses for violent criminals. If Democrats advocate for better policing but put forward ways to achieve this without giving police more draconian powers they could win with multiple constituencies.6) Military spending cuts would be a good idea in my opinion but the problem is that most people have very little understanding of military realities and it is easy to fearmonger claiming that such spending cuts would significantly damage US security even if they wouldn't. Democrats might be able to make some headway on the issue by emphasizing foreign aid cuts and cuts packaged as attempts to increase efficiency. Unfortunately a too-direct attempt to tackle the issue might cause ill-informed people to react in fear as if the nation was being made less safe.,0
Look instead of making Medicare mandatory for everyone why not just open it up as something that people can buy into? Everyone has a Medicare deduction come out of their paycheck now (or if self-employed they pay into it yearly)... why not just make it an option to double your contribution to and then you'll be on it as a primary insurance? You can still buy supplemental private insurance through your employer or on the open market to fill the inevitable deductible gaps (as a lot of senior citizens do now) but your catastrophic coverage is guaranteed.I don't see how this is rocket science. The additional payroll contributions should go a long way in paying for the additional expenses.,1
I know I'm going to be downvoted but whatever. This is the same typical hot air from Sanders. His big head is so full of it I'm surprised he hasn't floated away. There's no chance this bill will actually be voted on by the Senate let alone pass. This is political branding nothing more. He's trying to portray himself as some crusader of the people while simultaneously accomplishing absolutely nothing. This is political grandstanding to a minority of Americans who already make up his base. It's not reaching out to anyone new and he knows he won't be held accountable to his promises because it's never going to become a reality anyway. He can say whatever he wants and the people will eat it up. This is no different than Trump spewing bullshit and his supporters lapping it up because it's what they *want* to hear.,1
That's cool. Did he introduce it on the state level first to see if the plan is viable? If it's so much cheaper then obviously it would be a gigantic hit and all the states would just implement it themselves right?No?So basically he wants a completely untested system being implemented nation wide that could very well bankrupt the entire nation? Awesome!As an independent sick of both parties I'm going to have to say no. States are meant to be a testing grounds for this kind of thing. If not a single state is willing to try it themselves...why should be force it on the entire nation? If the voters of a single state don't find it attractive enough why are we attempting to force it on the entire nation? Make it work on the state level first. Until then I can not vote for any person that advocates for nationalized healthcare. I want to see it successfully implemented in at least ONE state before forcing it on all of us.,1
>The new system would be underwritten by an increase in taxes.this is where you lose my approval.  There is NO NEED FOR A TAX INCREASE TO PAY FOR SINGLE PAYER CARE.We spend 10s of BILLIONS a year on military.  We send BILLIONS a year to other countries for military aid.  We send BILLIONS MORE to other countries and companies for subsidies.Want my support?  Fix the spending and re-apply appropriate fiscal budgets to the healthcare issue.FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.Raising taxes on an already over taxed country to pay for a program that should already be budgeted is fucking ridiculous.,1
"This won't pass. There are too many problems with it and I'm all for single-payer. First and foremost -  Nobody wants increased taxes. The statement that ""Companies currently paying your premium will now be able to boost your wages"" is laughably unrealistic. No these companies will give that money right to their shareholders. You're going to have to convince people that the increased taxes offset the decrease in insurance spending. To really fix our healthcare system you're going to have to break a lot of things and rebuild from the ground.There are simply too many health insurance companies and hospitals that rely on our overly complex and bureaucratic maze of a system to extract profit from customers. The people in health insurance companies millions of employees in total will be out of a job. More importantly for the success of this legislation is that these companies will cease to exist. They will fight tooth and nail to protect themselves.Ultimately I do believe universal healthcare is possible but we first need to completely re-engineer the healthcare system. We need to get rid of the existing Medicare/medicaid alongside with private insurance and build a new system that accurately reflects costs. Hospitals are directly responsible for this. So long as they continue to charge insanely overpriced fees to the government and private insurance companies we will never be able to get rid of our current system. IF and that's a huuuuge if hospitals agree to set prices of procedures and goods to a realistic price this would be the first step of many. Next you'd have to deal with multi-billion dollar private health insurance companies facing extinction and somehow compensate for the economic impact of billions of dollars fleeing from capital markets and millions of employees finding themselves unemployed.Finally you'd have to find a way to get around the private sector using health insurance as a way to retain their employees. Again you're dealing with lobbyists with a vested interest in the status quo and deep pockets to keep it. If you can convince corporate America that they're better off not having the competitive advantage of employer-provided healthcare then you might just get away with it.All these things together present a near insurmountable hurdle. Our system is clearly and undeniably inferior to single payer in other first world nations but the amount of work we'd have to undergo to fix it would cause so much grief and divide that it really comes down to whether or not its survivable without fracturing the nation.TL;DR: Raising taxes and expanding govt-subsidized healthcare won't work. Healthcare as a right needs to be built from the ground up as a new system. That means that the old system will have to die a painful death that will wreak economic havoc. I don't think we're capable as a nation of opening wounds like that. I hope I'm wrong.",1
>During the first year of the program the eligibility age for the Medicare program would drop to 55 and all Americans under 18 would be added to the program. The eligibility age would gradually decrease until the fourth year when everyone would receive a ã¢universal Medicare cardã¢.And money won't be going to CHIP and Medicaid for those under 18 or for seniors (Medicaid). This is why he ran. He wanted to build support. The thing that drives me crazy is people act like they have zero creativity when discussing this stuff. They talk about taxes going up and how half the population will get it free off the backs of others because they don't pay any taxes. But it doesn't have to be that way. They could design the program so that you pay your Medicare for All premium whether you owe taxes or not or at least a portion of it. If you receive some other form of government assistance it could be deducted from that prior to disbursement. ,0

Will the Medicare for All bill (and subsequent bills cover)1. Health Insurance worker compensation (3-5 Million Unemployed Rest folded into government another government cost)2. Reduction of Pharmacy and Medication cost which will result in excuse by Pharma Bosses to reduce worker force3. Reduction of Hospital Costs which will reduce hospital staff4. Reduction in Physician salaries which are among the highest in the world. **in USA avg. Salary of Physician in  2008 was $186582 versus $125000 in Canada $159000 in Britain and just $92000 in Australia* The gap is believed to be even higher now in 2016.Not only will this be a Medicare for all bill this will cut the entire healthcare industry (which have jobs) for much lesser healthcare industry in SIZE but it will give the start to begin taxing people to cover the remaining cost after all the slashes to overhead mentioned above is done.,1
>Standing in opposition to Sandersã¢ø plan are what he calls the ã¢most powerful and greedy forces in American societyã¢: the pharmaceutical industry insurance companies Wall Street and the Republican party.Pharmaceutical companies are actually in favor of a system like this.

Decriminalize Marijuana and other drugs as well and you'll quickly see healthcare costs drop drastically as medicine that normally cost hundreds of dollars per pill drops down to a few bucks.,0

Has Bernie ever presented any kind of timeline he thinks this could get done in? I'm worried that when it doesn't pass the first couple times that people will lose hope and get apathetic. I'd like to know what he plans to do about that especially since he is rather old and won't be around to save us forever. It's not like he has a prodigy that will take over for him and clearly liberals are lacking leaders they really like. Beyond just sticking with a push for Single Payer how do you keep people interested when they get their hopes up and then get disappointed some because I'm pretty sure that will happen at least for awhile. We aren't going to go from Trump to Single Payer in 4 years and even 8 seems like a short time for that much of a swing. I think it's possible in 6-8 but not 4. AND It's only possible if liberals vote like they mean it for 6 years in a row three BIG elections and all the little ones in between! YOU CAN DO IT! However I want Bernie to tell you that.How will he fight the potentially long fight that this will take without losing support for not getting it passed in 2 or 4 years? That's really always been the question with his big promises HOW and WHEN and HOW! How can anybody keep liberals motivated to vote! They love to dream big and they love to embrace apathy when they don't get what they want. It doesn't seem like it will be easy. We need more charismatic liberal leaders.,1
"It would actually be really bad if it passes since it's not a complete bill. Much like every past time Bernie has pushed a bill like that it hasn't included how to pay for the change and all the other details needed to make an actual Medicare for all system.There's a reason why the ACA was over 300 pages long. It needed to be to properly outline how to have a healthcare system and cover all the things needed in that topic. If Bernie's current bill passed it would basically be a ""healthcare system"" with nothing to actually enact it with. And I certainly hope Republicans don't try to pull a bait and switch where they pass Bernie's bill as a way to get rid of the ACA without having to do anything else.â?",1
Honestly I'm getting a little frustrated at sanders here if you want this to be a meaningful discussion on how to do healthcare you need your bill to be costed. If it isn't it just doesn't matter. How much will this plan cost where will that money be raised what happens to the tens of thousands of americans who work in Health insurance offices what do we do to ensure that the doctors are not overbooked when appointments are free and there is no barrier to use.  I want to see you guys get Single payer it is where you need to go but we need to talk seriously about how you cross the crocodile infested waters between here and there. If you want to tax the rich fine but you need details how much money needs to be raised 1 trillion? 2? 1.346 trillion? If so what kind of tax rate increase does that represent on corporation tax on estate tax etc. Is it 8% increase in income tax for the top 10% of earners is it 9.5%?    This plan has symbolic value it may even have campaign value in 2020 but it leaves so many unanswered questions :/ ,1
**Couple questions**1) 1/3 of the funding is estimated to come from the states how in the world is the federal government going to convince 34-35 Republican governors to sign such a law?* Also 69/99 state legislature are Republican controlled* Most states have a 60% vote threshold for passing a large tax hike which makes it harder.2) How is Sanders plan going to get doctors to join the public system when they are paid much less?* I ask because Sanders during the primaries said he would make it part of the law doctors have to see public option people this would be a SCOTUS challenge and I don't see even Liberal justices like Kegan or Byer supporting that3) Colorado had a referendum for the basic level universal system and it failed 80%-20% so how are they going to convince people?4) To pass a law like this would take 60 votes in the senate and I don't see Republicans and even moderate Democrats supporting this.,1
"Show the Numbers THE REAL NUMBERS.  Because every time this crackpot waves his hands around and talks about this concept he acts like the rich in this country are hiding the magical money tree.   There is a reason that even California abandoned single payer.  It's untenable.  His ""plan"" during the 2016 Primaries would have cost somewhere between 18-35 Trillion Dollars and you aren't getting that money from the 1% that's coming straight from the Middle Class and Small Businesses.  It's ruinous it's ludicrous and it's idiotic but so is Socialism and every idiot on the Internet likes to pretend that ""if we just did it right"" we wouldn't become the next Soviet Union or Venezuela (we would) because somehow we are more like the thinly populated culturally homogenous Nordic States (we aren't) than we are those to failed states.  ",1
We have 50 states each one very different try 50 different plans? Learn from each? Doesn't that make sense? Vermont has only 642000 residents California almost 40 million. Just seems like the logical approach to me. What works share what does not work discard. How successful organizations are built.Still don't understand why a region like Brooklyn of 3 million-plus residents does not run their own plan. Just remove the insurance companies from the equation. Charge $100 a month per resident make everyone a shareholder. That's $300M a month you can move mountains with that kind of cash. You can build your own big pharm labs hire top talent modernize hospitals send kids to Medical School. We have the internet we have the cloud hospital IT is stuck in 1997.I WANT my healthcare records seen crowd source my MRI's. Everyone can see my Venmo transaction I don't really care. If you want to lock down your personal records fine but give me a choice.Healthcare needs to be disrupted. It's time.Source: Bernie supporter,0

If by some chance he succeeds in spending our cash to keep everyone healthy then what will our tax be to keep everyone alive after 70 then 80 then 90?  What did I miss?  I thought there were only two guarantees in life and dying was one of them.  How about we take the other approach.  We eat right don't kill ourselves with drugs and alcohol and if our genes are so fuck up we shouldn't breed then live life fast and die.  Just don't fucking bread.  The fact that we have to spend every fucking penny on ensuring that each and every person lives ten seconds longer than they should simply means that we've forgotten there is an afterlife and perhaps they should be panicking.,1
"From what I read from several sources (CNN CBS some outlets I can't remember off the top of my head); they're updating Sander's bill from 2008 and taking the House Bill into account since only that chamber can approve spending.HR 676: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/SR 1723 introduced in 2007: https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/3413/textI should mention this is more of a proposal instead of some several hundred page behemoth that'll cover the intricacies. Everything isn't outlined it's not gone through the ""process"" of stuffing riders and the nuts and bolts but it gives an idea.They might just scrap those two and come up with a new one altogether but seeing how it's the same sponsor and the house has one in the process you can probably piece it together.**EDIT** I think the proposal if it passes is meant to get traction on the system being set-up. As in giving them a timeline. I could be wrong though I am very tired and may have misread a few things.",0
"I don't think so.  And it might not even be fully released when he officially unveils it.  And it's important to be able to read the thing before we get behind it because the most important thing won't be in the five minute stump speech that Sanders prepares.  The big question is does it ban competing health care plans from private companies?  If not ""Medicare for All"" is an option and it will be something great for Democrats to rally around and something that will be hard for Republicans to make a case against.  It will be popular because people will be able to make a choice. If it does ban competing private health care plans like the Conyers Bill ""Medicare for All"" is a mandate and this will be a huge boondoggle that will ensnare all branches of government and will make passing Obamacare look like passing a House Resolution proclaiming ""America is Awesome!"".

"When it comes to healthcare politics there are 3 groups on Reddit 1. People who **don't remember shit**2. People who **remember how hard ACA was**3. People who **remember how hard ACA was** and **how Hillarycare failed**Everyone reading this should take a second to HONESTLY grade yourself. What group are you in? There's necessarily an age factor here. You'd need to be 35 to have been 12 when Hillarycare went down to defeat. So dear reader: are you 35? 25? 20? or are you a 17 year old who spent last April photoshopping that sparrow that landed on Bernie's podium and downvoting everyone who said he wouldn't win 60% of the delegates from New York?The utmost concession to reality ever offered by Group-1-ers is ""sure we can't do it now but give us a filibuster proof majority and a D President in a few years and we'll do it."" In other words they think that **AT WORST** this is going to be as hard a fight as ACA. That's totally wrong. There's a reason ACA didn't have Harry and Louise ads run against it. it's because every stakeholder in the healthcare lobby knew they had to be on board the bus or get run over by the bus; at the same time the Democratic Congress did not include certain policies (like the public option) because they feared that those stakeholders would be pushed into an existential fight for existence.(If you're wondering ""What are Harry and Louise ads?"" you're *so* in group 1)We need a single payer healthcare insurance program in America but ""Medicare For All"" is not a real plan. It's a rhetorical pivot like the way Frank Luntz rebranded the estate tax as the ""death tax"" to make it easier to fight. People only glommed onto ""Medicare for all"" because they think it'll make it easier to ""sell"" SPH to ""the dumb rubes"" but that is not the way politics works. If you think that you don't remember the town halls of August 2009. You cannot just remake the American economy with a slogan and expect to withstand scrutiny. What you need is a plan with an online calculator where anyone can go online enter their family's income and economic data and compare their tax increase vis-a-vis putative healthcare savings. None of these BUT IT SHOULD BE A RIGHT slogans actually create a plan that delivers this political *sine qua non*. That's why indeed the Bookers and Harrises of the Senate are only signing onto this symbolically and if we ever get a majority again while Bernie lives he and his repeal-and-replace-of-the-iconoclast-left will get left. Senator Sanders had a chance during the primary to put out a healthcare plan and he finally released a six page color pamphlet that was [eviscerated by left-leaning economists](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/us/politics/left-leaning-economists-question-cost-of-bernie-sanderss-plans.html?mcubz=0) who had [nothing to do with the Hillary campaign](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-bernie-sanderss-health-care-plan-leaves-out). In particular the planned prescription drugs *savings* were larger than the total America *spends* on prescription drugs. Imagine if I told you I can sell you an amazing car that's so affordable because it will save you $450 a month on gas. ""But I only spend $390 a month on gas!"" you say. ""NEOLIBERAL HILLSHILL"" you reply. That was the Democratic primary in a nutshell.",1
And we were headed there *before reddit knew who bernie was* too... which is why it bothers me that he's given all the credit. What about Obamacare which laid the groundwork for expanded health coverage? What about Hillary Clinton's push for universal care in the 90s? What about LBJ's push for it in the 60s? And FDR's push for it in the 30s? Bernie didn't invent not did he even popularize the concept of universal healthcare or single payer he just introduced it to a particular group of politically apathetic millenials who would have known about it earlier had they been paying any attention to politics before Bernie ran. ,0
It is where we are headed but it's going to be more than several years.  We have a long way to go and we need to make smaller steps (public option) first.  Even a democratic congress with a filibuster-proof majority isn't going to pass single payer in the next several years or the next decade.  There is of course the lobbyist and campaign finance issue but it would also put 460000 people out of work overnight... and these are people with pretty good jobs.If we want single payer to happen we need to focus on things that are achievable in the near future that move us in that direction.  The big goals become achievable when they aren't so far away and when the shock to the economy wouldn't be so large. It's great that these senators have made their wishes known but this is the practical equivalent of all of those votes to repeal Obamacare - they are doing it because they know that it isn't going to be passed anytime soon. ,1
"Democrats have been pushing for UHC for over half a century now.  And they've made progress but it's been hard fought and there's a long way still to go.  Today's stunt doesn't move us any closer and a realistic timeframe is more likely measured in decades than years.Remember: to even pass it you'll need a solid majority of the House 60 votes in the Senate and a Democratic President.  And all of them will have to agree to a specific plan one where there will be real winners and losers not just an aspirational outline that glosses over every single difficult decision.And you're going to have to sell that plan to a wide majority of the public.  Because if you try to ""solve"" healthcare in a partisan manner you're going to end up handing the GOP base red meat to invoke a wave election to dismantle it just like what happened after the ACA passed.  If you want real and lasting change you're going to have to convince a large swath of the nation to support it.",1
How are they doing to curtail the ridiculous costs in the current system? One ER visit for some stitches cost my friend a bill of $9000. Not kidding. With a medical mafia like that how does pushing those ridiculous costs to the government solve anything ? I believe the first order of things is to establish a framework for medical costs before this can be tackled at scale. I don't support paying a lot more taxes to cover this insanity that is our current medical establishment.I don't remember a single occasion with any hospital where the costs seemed in line with the procedure. They seem to be designed to extract/negotiate the maximum money from the insurers.,1
As an American it blew my mind when I went to Ontario to visit my uncle who was hospitalized last year. I think he collapsed at home due to stomach ulcers and was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. He had surgery there and stayed at the hospital for 10 days. I went to the billing office to ask on his behalf what his bill would look like. There was no line and the lady basically like if he had his OHIP card with him he's all good for his hospital fees he only has to pay $45 for his ambulance. That was shocking. My aunt here in the US once took herself to the hospital and they took a look at her and said oh she should've gone to the building next door then proceeded to strap her into a stretcher stuff her into an ambulance drove her next door and charged her close to $1K for the ambulance fee only. She said afterwards if she had known she would've walked over instead lol. I don't know how much they charged her for treatment but I wouldn't be surprised if it were $10k or more. It's ridiculous. Something is just really wrong.,0
Haha $15 for pain medication. This reminds me of the time I got sick on vacation in London. I visited an NHS clinic and was seriously shocked when I stepped out of the doctor's office and did not immediately encounter a secretary's desk with a credit card machine. I almost walked back up the receptionist to inquire about how I was supposed to pay before I realized I was *not* supposed to pay. It still almost felt wrong just walking out like I was pulling a fast one or something. Then I took my prescription to the pharmacy and this time I knew there would be no completely free drugs. So I did some googling and determined that my health insurer was in network with some foreign pharmacies. I mentioned this to the pharmacist and she very professionally walked me through the process for submitting that claim and then subtly suggested without mocking me that the medicine would only cost $8 if I just paid cash. My co-pay on insurance for drugs was $15 anyway. I wish I could read my own story from the perspective of a Brit just to see how insane it sounds.,0
"Just an added little note - going to the ER in the US would also probably take about 6 hours on a good day. I'm just saying that because the ""wait time"" flag is always raised whenever people try to downgrade the Canadian system. So - you had the same time in the ER as the average American on a good day AND you didn't need to pay for the visit AND you did not have to pay one or two thousand $$ a month for your insurance plan.We are literally the stupidest people in the universe if we don't adopt a similar system. (I mean we've already proven ourselves to be insanely stupid this year but on top of that).",0
This sounds amazing. Compare this with the typical american experience: Have a problem call to schedule an appointment with whatever doctor you think might be best. Better hope they accept your insurance. Wait 3-6 months before you can go in if you're a new patient (this drops down to anywhere between a week and 3 months if you're a recurring patient). Go in fill out a bunch of paperwork make sure you write down and share all of the insurance info your ID etc. Wait several hours before you can see the doctor. Doctor prescribes blood test and tells you to come back in a week/month/whatever. The fee is $100-200 but you got 'insurance' so you don't see this price tag until 1-2 months later. Your insurance naturally denies all the claims and sends you a bill for the full amount.You go get your blood test done doing the exact same process. Luckily this time you can walk in immediately (waiting for the rest of the people there). Forms insurance id then get your blood test. This costs anywhere from $100-2000 depending on what's done. Possibly more. Insurance is billed like the gods they are. 1-2 months later you find your insurance company has yet again denied paying and forwarded the bill for the full amount to you.After 1-3 months you go back to your doctor following the exact same process as the first time (fortunately no paperwork this time). Again wait a few hours after the scheduled time and you finally have your doctor prescribe what you need. You live insurance is billed for $100-200 and in typical fashion they forward you the bill. You will do this every 1-4 months for the duration that you're on the pills.So you go to fill out the prescription. Repeat until you find a pharmacy that doesn't charge you $100-400 for pills: Show insurance/id and prescription wait 5-10 minutes for them to tell you your insurance doesn't cover it. Hope to god it's cheap. At best pay $5 for each at worst pay hundreds. Wait 20 minutes while prescription is filled. Pay the amount and leave. Pills acquired.No clue how surgery and hospitals work but I can only imagine it's hell if this is how regular doctor visits are.,0
"I think the sponsors of the bill need to heavily push a message that this is the ""replace"" promised by republicans. They need to hammer it in that this is how you ""get rid of Obamacare and get people affordable healthcare."" Use the terminology of the republican promises to justify the bill. That will make it far harder for the republicans in power who want to squash it to justify their positions.It will also make for great talking points in future elections. Anyone against universal healthcare should be facing challenges. They should have their feet held to the fire for why they want to preserve a broken system.",0
Wouldn't need to raise taxes if we shifted most of the funds spent on the current welfare state (especially social security which is a useless poorly crafted retirement program) to a universal health care system. It's about priorities: people can get jobs in this economy just fine (unemployment is incredibly low right now). Being healthy and well is far more important than having the government help pay for your housing (or subsidize your food bill...cut back on the fancy meats and avocado toast folks!). We have to have priorities: not everything can have money thrown at it at the same time. ,1
"I will work and vote to make sure this ""goal"" never happens.I understand the potential cost savings etc. but I am philosophically opposed to the government having its hands in every facet of life. The federal government has already grown far far too big already and needs to be reigned in.In fact ""Medicare for All"" sounds downright evil to me because CMS's reimbursement rates are so low and demands so high that health systems could not stay in business on government payors alone right now. Recent regulations have made it so that private physician practices have had to sell to large health systems in order to remain compliant.I would much rather pay a little more per year for my excellent coverage.What I would like to see is for the multinational pharmaceutical market to open up. That would be a huge help in driving down US health care costs.",1
"No one is even suggesting somehow outlawing private health care or insurance. I'm Swedish we already have universal healthcare but I have private health/accident insurance *as well* because it's affordable and it makes sense. And I don't eat the argument about raising taxes. For those for whom Medicare for all would replace private health insurance the raised taxes would be lower than the cost of the insurance quite likely and because *everyone* would be covered there wouldn't even be anyone who could say ""they raise my taxes and I get nothing for it"". You get cheaper guaranteed health insurance. It's time America. In fact it's way past time already. ",0
I think this would be a much more realistic and safer approach. What I find strange with all of these discussions is that single payer is equated with universal healthcare when there are in fact several other systems out there which reach the same goal while being more likely to work in the American environment. For instance Australia or Germany's public and private system or Switzerland's fully private but highly regulated system. They are not single payer but work well if not better than single payer systems like Canada's. I do not think single payer Medicare-for-all will ever pass and for good reason. Erasing such a big segment of the US economy will have drastic consequences. Plus I do not think that the average American would support such a system. We have it in our mindset that if you have the money you should be able to buy better care and I see nothing wrong with this. But there should definitely still be universal access to care. I just do not agree that single payer is the best way for the US to achieve that goal.,0
"Im so sorry to hear about your father. I can't imagine what it's like to go through something like that. This healthcare system is fucked on so many levels. A guy that I work with had a reasonable (but not perfect) healthcare plan through his wife's job. She got diagnosed with cancer a couple of years ago and had to stop working because of it. She (and he) then lost her health insurance right when she needed it the most which became an enormous financial burden. She passed away almost a year later and my friend/colleague was then left with a huge amount of debt and is now considered single in terms of taxes which has fucked him over even further (which is a whole thing in and of itself.) It just sucks so much and it's so hard seeing other countries that are less wealthy than the US having systems that seem fairly functional that don't drive people into bankruptcy while we're here paying for these fucking wars all over the world. We have no problem paying for the war on terror or the war on drugs which show virtually NO results meanwhile we have people sick and dying here. In Bernie's words ""We can do better.""",0
Simply a bad idea to raise capital gains: hurting investments to keep poor people healthy is just a backwards way of looking at the health care economy. I'm a fiscal conservative: this money needs to come from the same source it's funding the welfare state. That means shifting money away from SS and cash transfers (food stamps TANF even W.I.C.). It's going to require a lot of restructuring and the ending of promises that should never have been made (like retiring on the government's time...people need to invest in their own retirements). I would very much prefer health savings accounts but it's hard to do something like that in a way that would actually cover typical health costs without a mandate (which removes the idea that they're voluntary or curated by the individual). Hong Kong does it this way and it's a mandate which can also be accomplished (in a more indirect way) through taxation. ,1
Nah payout rates for the uninsured is abysmal for hospitals and ambulances. I work in ambulance billing and it's common for our clients to have 1 in 20 OR LESS uninsured people pay their bill. 1 in 5 uninsured paying for their ambulance ride would be considered really good. This is why we're happy to accept medicaid even though they typically only pay something like 10% of the full rate.Hospitals and ambulances have the most to gain from universal healthcare since payment would become much more reliable. It's going to be Health insurance companies that oppose this because the vast majority of their business would dissolve overnight.,1
"Nothing bans private companies from running private insurance or hospitals. Most universal healthcare systems have those. They just a many times redundant and thus a much smaller sector of economy. Also it means said inssurance must provide actual extra value since they cant hold the ""if you don't get coverage you dead"" argument over their customers heads.Usually it is stuff like getting faster to non acute treatmeant (stuff you would like taken care faster but medically you could wait. Thus public sector puts you on lower priority thus might have to wait some time because acute treatment has higher priority to resources) fancier surround (nicer private rooms fancier food etc.) Etc etc.One additional possible private sector thing is employers offering occupational health services from private sector on top of governmental system.",0
I'll play:1) Given your other views getting to this is impressive.2) It's as hard to get into this country as it's ever been certainly much tougher than your parents or grandparents faced.3) More hungry kids can't follow you there.  We've already got more than enough.4) Sure whatever.  Americans are armed to the teeth.  The idea that we have any effective gun control is laughable.5) Violent crime is at all time lows pretty much everywhere.  6) Projecting power through foreign aid is much cheaper than projecting it militarily.  There is a ton of fat in the military budget and it should be cut directly.  But of course right wing media will treat this as the end of the world as they always do.Democrats lose because they can't get people to the polls partly because of apathy partly because Republicans are making it hard to vote.  They need to motivate their base I'm not sure this bill will do it but it's at least an attempt.,0
I totally *want* to get behind a Universal Healthcare Plan. And I'd be perfectly happy to get behind single payer if the math worked out.But no one has actually put forth a workable plan yet. Even this latest Sanders bill touts amazing lavish benefits but doesn't really describe how we'd pay for it. How can he responsibly offer a bill without a substantive discussion of financing? (I understand that he's taken stabs at a financing plan in the past. But this plan is not coupled with a real discussion of funding.)It's even more upsetting to me that all these Senators aligned behind what is essentially a sham bill. This feels like the sort of irresponsible thing I'd expect from Republicans.My problem isn't so much with Medicare For All as a solution but the fact that we've been hearing the idea bandied about for years and we're still awaiting a responsible financially sound plan.,0
Umm this is nothing like that lolBernie is a long term guy - he is doing this now to get people interested so he's already got as many on board as he can once he can actually make the move.  This is how politics works. Things take a lot of time and some ideas don't come to fruition for decades.  But I mean you can tell just by how many democrats have come out in support of single payer healthcare this year that this is getting stronger not weaker. And that means this is likely to be a main platform in the next election and as soon as a democrat gets in office the ball will begin to roll. ,0
 >There is NO NEED FOR A TAX INCREASE TO PAY FOR SINGLE PAYER CARE.Indeed.Simply...we spend 2 to 3x more for healthcare than the rest of the Western world because of our catastrophically inefficient system.Go to a doctor in Europe: There's no herd of administrative assistant working for him/her trying to figure out billing. There's *one* person. American patients pay for these eployeesIn all major US cities out of 10 people coming into the ER how many have insurance? 2? 3? Those with insurance pay for those without wether they want it or not.There are many more examples like that.Universal healthcare would tackle a lot of these cost-increasing factors.,1
I agree we need serious tax reform. Especially where we spend it of course. That being said I'd love to see some more studies that show how much we pay out of pocket on average to what we would see as a tax increase. In most countries they pay much much less than we do for healthcare services so even with a bit of an income tax hike they end up pay much less at the end of the year.Perhaps this wont be the case with us here in the US but if it is I hope that Bernie makes more of a point to make this clear. That's how it's supposed to work anyways... we'd save money in the end in a perfect world.,0
"I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.   If you want to have healthcare then a better plan would be to purchase some health  insurance coverage. You're actually required to have it.  If you can't afford it the gov't will assist you in purchasing some.   If you don't want to purchase health insurance - my understanding is that President Trump has instructed the IRS to stop going after people for that like they were when Obama was President. Also I don't think Bernie was declaring that Dental Care is a ""fundamental right"" which it isn't.   So as for dental care you probably need to get some dental insurance - Unless you are very poor in which case there are state programs which will assist you in getting basic dental health services.   Good Luck !! ",1
"During the campaign his economic advisor was Stephanie Kelton. She's an economist associated with ""Modern Monetary Theory"".  One of the things emphasized by that group  is that the federal government can pay for things without having to first get money through taxation or issuing debt. Most people probably associate that idea with the phrase ""printing money"" and they are concerned that it would cause inflation. Critics are quick to bring up Zimbabwe and the  the Weimar Republic. I'm not persuaded by the comparison without some proof that the increased demand for health care would cause demand inflation but if someone had some evidence that it would I'd consider it. I think the reason Sanders would avoid making these funding arguments is that they're very counter intuitive to people and trying to move towards single payer is already a huge lift without having to also try to persuade people that the monetary system doesn't work like they think it does.",0
It shows even more Americans how evil and selfish the Republicans are.  The Democrat framing of their ACA repeal brought positive swings in American views of medicare and the ACA (as long as it wasn't tied to that black man).  Now we have Bernie who was pretty darn popular with most of America just not the DNC putting together something that is FOR the 99%.  They know it.All the sexist misogynists who hated Hillary because she was female but not because she was a corporatist war hawk or anything will nod along and murmur that Bernie's ideas certainly sound like a good idea.,0
"To show he is serious enough about his policy stance to show it as bill on the record. As in ""This is not some vague concept of universal healthcare I support . When I say I support said policy I mean this policy written out to detail in black and white and on public record.""This means if someone says they are against Bernie can say ""which part"". ""There is a bill about this. If you say you don't like this policy could you please show which statutes of the bill you have issue with."" Cuts wings of drive by critics because they can't just say this policy would mean this or that because what is actually proposed is on record. So opposition can't strawman the policy so easily.Also to make opposite side vote against it to put their stance on record. Plus it is a possibility for supporters put their support on public record.",0
Your employer eats most of that insurance cost. In high risk fields about 18% of their budgets go to insurance. That is factored in when hiring new people and helps determine pay rates.If this bill is paid for in a similar fashion to his other Medicare for All proposals your employer's contribution will drop down to a little over 6% freeing up a lot of funds for other use.Unions already have plans to petition for pay raises out of that money because it's already used to account for your personal cost to the company.Otherwise you could see it being used for new equipment  more coworkers or just other benefits. If I can make two assumptions about you: that you have two pay periods per month and you make around $60k a year? In that circumstance even with a wife and two kids you'd pay even less than what you currently do if this new bill has a tax system similar to Bernie's other proposals on the matter. Basically you'd keep that $28 per pay period and your taxes would increase about $20 per pay period net savings of $8 per pay period.,0
"> I'm not paying thousands of dollars per year to go into a medical cost pool when I never even go to the doctor.What's next?

And Medicare uses a well known feature of the market to its advantage the monopoly. We don't allow them to exist usually because their economies of scale allow them to be far too efficient cost-wise for competitors to keep up. This is exactly what we need for medicine to make it cheaper and widely available. Also less red tape you just go in see your doctor and that's it. No paper work. No claims. No one there to process forms and deny claims (well not as many). It's extremely simplified process. Doctors also just then need to sum up their bills at the end of the month or what ever and just bill Medicare no need to chase up unpaid bills or deal with different insurance agencies. ,0
"Yeah the problem is that the system has been moving in a badly-constructed ""private health insurance"" manner for almost a century now. It was perfectly decent 100 years ago (it was actually a private system with the government having little involvement) but the doctors complained they weren't getting paid enough (there was too much competition and licensing wasn't a big deal so supply of doctors was much looser than today). So they effectively formed a profession union via the AMA which has strangled the system ever since then with increasing regulations licensing requirements and educational strictures. That's all fine...if you want a system that just keeps getting more and more expensive.As a classic liberal health care has deeply troubled me: I do not want socialized medicine (it's just not economical) but private insurance has almost completely failed at this point. We need a system that keeps costs down and holds people accountable for their health care services. It's simply a mess right now...I'm very cautiously optimistic that some kind of sea-change can improve it in a better direction. Still my biggest concern is obvious: we will continue to struggle with keeping costs down and will have to resort to longer waiting times and denial of service to ""more costly""  (i.e. very elderly) treatment options. It's a very mixed bag any way you slice it. ",0
Bernie himself has said this doesn't have a chance of passing right now with this Congress but politics isn't a zero sum game.Republicans voted more than 60 times to repeal and replace Obamacare while Obama was still in office. They knew they wouldn't get their wish but by actively campaigning and voting for it (over and over again) they convinced the American public (Republicans anyway) that it was an important issue that needed to be a focus of future elections.Medicare-For-All is an important issue that needs to be a focus of American politics.16 Senators and 117 House Representatives supporting Medicare For All is a hell of a start. We're going to push for much more support across the board from our currently elected representatives and from the candidates who challenge them in future elections.,0
2018 is super optimistic.  Like we'll need the ACA to get rejected before the end of this year and people will unfortunately need to be dying in the streets outside of insurance companies and hospitals with letters denying claims in order for people to get mobilized enough to maybe force politicians to change their attitude by the END of 2018 at best.No I think this is still a 2025-ish thing and we'll have some slightly worse misery than now until then.  2020 will be interesting since The Donald and Republicans in Congress getting reelected would likely slow it even further,0
"I remember all that and I remember the constant demonization of Hillary throughout the 90s and I remember the accusations of ""socialism"" and ""communism"" and ""liberalism"" during the Bush years and post 9-11.  And I remember the episode of The Ellen Show where she first came out of the closet only to be quickly cancelled by ABC and called obscene by the prominent conservatives of the time.  Things change sometimes very quickly.  The best way to affect that change is to truly believe it is possible.  Pessimism is practical for our own emotional stability but not in pushing forward changes that a society needs.  I'm in Group 3 but I'll gladly stand with Group 1 on this. ",0
">People only glommed onto ""Medicare for all"" because they think it'll make it easier to ""sell"" SPH to ""the dumb rubes"" but that is not the way politics worksThat's an incredibly cynical way to look at efforts to make the philosophical underpinnings of a political debate more accessible to broad American audiences. Sanders et al are pushing for a radical change to the U.S. healthcare system. You're right that it's clearly a tough fight but naturally in any fight you'll end up doing better with momentum; the 'Medicare for All' slogan immediately forms a bridge for the most people possible between a hypothetical future and a current political reality certainly cutting through barriers of educational attainment and English language status better than 'Single Payer Healthcare'.Drawing people into the topic is the first major step towards a reflection on the underlying ideas of a piece of legislation and the real-life context in which it would unfold. That **is** how politics works.",1
Thank you. I am 100% in favor of a single payer system. But my wants and dreams don't create reality. Hard policy work does. And sorry Bernie is not a policy wonk. He's a speech guy. That isn't a slam. We need speech guys to sell the policies wonks design.I hope all this is right now is a rhetorical salvo off the GOP's bow. Democrats are taking stock of how malleable the center is to this idea.Then whenever we get back Congress and the WH we can set out and do the real work of designing a way to transfer 1/6 of the U.S. economy from private hands to public hands. And that work will be hard messy painful annoying long and filled with compromises.If that turns you off please make another issue _your_ issue. ,0
"Here's one thing that whatever health-care bill we pass needs to be: Opt-in. Think about the single most effective attack on Obamacare. What was it? Not the higher premiums not the mandate - those were effective but not what people rallied around. The big Obamacare lie was ""if you like your plan you can keep it."" People don't like change and having the government come in and change something you're used to produces backlash.This is why a public-option opt-in system would be a significantly better and more strategically sound tack. This means that the only people making the switch (at first) would be those willing to and slowly it would drive costs down and become more socially accepted by the public. We can expand it from there.",0
I'm over 50.  The way I think about this is that this is a long haul project.  This shouldn't dissuade people.  The demographics are with us in the long term.  Furthermore if the GOP has shown us anything is that you can set goals ignore the naysayers and keep on pushing and it is likely to happen (even if the things they've pushed for are just fucking awful).  I say this  because I think Dems unlike the GOP tend to give up on currently unpopular ideas quickly rather than pushing them.  To be fair though the GOP's base is easy to manipulate and conservative media has a much better hold on them then liberal media as on its base.Still if we hunker down for the long hall and push the demographics will get us there though it may take a generation to do so.,0
I'm older than 35 so that's why I probably understand this more than the 90% of redditors who keep arguing 'single payer single payer single payer'. The plan that Bernie put out in the primaries was a complete joke. It provided little or no cost savings measures and it just basically shifted the full cost from the individual to the government WHILE also giving people more healthcare services and coverage. It was a joke. 'Single payer' healthcare used by the developed world (many are in fact mutli-player but lets go with it for now) has a lot of cost cutting measures. They limit who you can see when you can see it how long you have to wait etc. You're analogy to Frank Luntz and the 'death tax' is spot on. 'Single payer' is the left's 'death tax'.  Just saying 'single payer' is what allowed Bernie to push out a plan that proposed to save Americans more in prescription drugs than they actually spend right now....because with those magic words of 'single payer' you can say anything else and certain people will buy it. ,0
Things change. You're looking at politics as static when in fact the opposite is true. Trump was elected because he had a populist campaign. The Republicans just elected a populist. Actually they knowingly elected a con-artist who was pretending to be a populist. This should tell you just how much politics have shifted.People are fed up with not having enough money to pay for health care. And the Republicans just destroyed all their credibility when it comes to health care.The stage has been set for a populist overhaul of the healthcare system. It's absolutely possible. Is it likely? Nothing in politics is likely. Our system is designed to resist change from any direction. But if you don't try then you turn a 30 percent chance into a zero percent chance.,0
"I don't think any mature adult thinks that this will be an easy thing to do. I think your post makes a big assumption that the people for it do not understand the nuances of the issue. It is of course vastly complicated and upends quite a bit of the system we currently have. But we also need to face the reality that a lot of Americans do. We have a health care system that is too expensive for most people to take advantage of. I pay a little over $3600 a year for a $3000 deductible. It means that unless I am in dire need I avoid going to the doctor. And I know for a fact that I am better off than a lot of other people. What does that say about our system? The fact remains that we have a system that is no longer working and enough of the country is demanding a change.I know the point you are trying to make; it is absolutely difficult. But difficult does not equate to ""don't try"". We can't afford to not try. I don't think it is fair to equate a rough draft of an alternative plan intended for voters to get a general idea of it to an entire policy proposal. No voter is going to sit down and read thousands of pages of legalese to see how the plan will in effect roll out. It's a bit dishonest of you to try to pass that off as proof of it being something that cannot work in spirit. Obama did not come to the party with the thousands of pages that the ACA ended up being. You start with an idea and you tweak it to get as close to that ideal as you possibly can. If you as insinuating that Bernie should have come with that much data then you are not remembering Ross Perot's infomercials and how effective those were... Nothing and I mean nothing about our system makes any sense whatsoever. It is totally asinine and the ACA was simply a bandaid. I'm 35. I remember the 90's and that is ancient history. The playing field is different. The issues facing Americans are different. If the attitude we are going to take is ""that's too hard and complicated so lets not try"" then why do anything at all? In fact why should any ever vote for a Democrat if that is what they will offer? ""I'm not a Republican"" is demonstrably not good enough because that is not bringing people to the polls. ",0
"Remember? I live with it every day.How many people here actually have an elderly parent on Medicare or a spouse on Medicaid? Look up the ""Donut Hole"". Try to find a doctor that will take on additional Medicare/Medicaid patients. Try to find a corner clinic that takes Medicare/Medicaid (sorry you're only choice is wait for your doctor tomorrow/monday or go to the emergency room). Hope you have supplemental insurance in case Medicare/Medicaid doesn't cover  some of your prescriptions.True you may not have to  ""pay"" for care but that doesn't mean you'll get (timely) care either. There will be rationing.I used to get major medical health insurance for about $35/month. If I got sick I went to the doctor and paid him. If I needed antibiotics I paid the pharmacy. If I had a really bad year or got something major (cancer heart attack) THEN it kicked in. Because insurance is supposed to cover large unexpected costs not every single everyday cost. That's not insurance that's a warranty. And you couldn't afford car ""insurance"" if it was legislated to be delivered the same way as health insurance is now.And people actually PAY into Medicare for decades via FICA before they can see any of the benefits.But I do agree that health care is a ""right"". Just like freedom of speech is a right. Bearing arms is a right. But that doesn't mean the government gives you a radio station or an AR-15 for free. You have the right to seek treatment without undue restrictions by the government. That's what a right truly is. And that's why both parties are screwed up when the describe health care as a (or not a) ""Right"".",1
Because Bernie sanders has been building on this idea for decades I've been fighting for it for 17 years and there has never been this much support behind it.  I am making an assumption when I say it will definitely happen but that's because it's trending in that way.  If you look at other movements throughout history you'll notice that they started as a small idea then became a crazy idea then became a plausible idea then became a viral idea and then became reality. SlaveryWomen's right to vote Marijuana legislationGay marriage Among other things...what I notice when I look through history is that the progressives always ultimately win they just take a lot longer getting there.  But it's a steady uphill battle with small obstacles along the way.  Look at it over decades rather than months or even years. See Trump has his small wins here and there for his beliefs and his party but in the end we all know the next president will work diligently to undo everything he has done and we will ultimately get back to the progressive agenda.  The progressive agenda tends to be a constant underneath everything we see happening from day to day. It's slowly building momentum in the background while the show happens in the present.  Don't be too distracted by the show to acknowledge the whole picture. This is all just my thoughts.  You're welcome to disagree. ,0
This is the most techbro answer to a question that is not about tech. Doctors and the cost of training Doctors is not the main cost of health care in the US. For profit pharmaceutical companies and hospitals inflating insurance costs are amongst the biggest reasons for health inflation in the US. >Investing 1/1000 of what it would take to have universal healthcare into AI research and it would be much more effective.This is a ridiculous claim without any backing evidence for it. Yes there are technological policies which could help cut some costs- telemedicine for example. But the thing is we have evidence from across the world that universal healthcare is more efficient and cost effective than for profit healthcare so why would you throw that money into AI research when we know that the move to universal healthcare would be so much effective at providing healthcare for all?,0
Although he may have lost the primary Bernie Sanders earned himself some serious political capital within the Democratic party. If you had told even the people who liked and supported him that he would be packing 20K seat arenas and come as close as he did to winning the primary they'd have laughed at you. I have loved Bernie for YEARS and although I was happy to see him announce his candidacy I never thought at the start that he actually had a shot. He shook the party to its core in last year. Not only did he nearly win while running openly as a Democratic Socialist he seized complete control of the American youth voters. The Democratic Party always has and always will need the youth vote that Bernie was winning the 18-30 crowd by 60 70 and 80% and pulling record primary turnouts in that age group meant they HAD to give him a prominant voice. Even if they were (and are) kicking and screaming the whole way. ,0
Because it's not fully formed and it's not fully formed because it would require a tax increase. People don't want to be on record supporting a tax increase unless they can actually pass the increase and they do not have anywhere near the power to do that.This is leaving out that it would be very destructive to a large industry that employs thousands of people representing hundreds of billions in stock value or to phrase it differently it would crash part of the economy.It's something that needs to happen but doing as a partnership between public and private like most of Europe does would be far less disruptive.,0
"Sanders has the backing of Senators from mostly firmly Democratic states. These are the folks that would only lose their seats to people even further Left than they are. The other Dems who are not yet supporting the bill are the ones who actually have to fight off strong Republican challenges and can't risk alienating the centrists and moderates by supporting a very far Left wing bill in its infancy. Right now the name of the game is winning elections in 2018 not passing legislation. Especially since if Bernie by some miracle puts this bill on Trump's desk and gets Trump to sign it into law Republicans will blast it as a massive right wing victory from now until the 2020 election. ""Trump promised to fix Obamacare and look at how much money you're saving now!""The average voter isn't smart enough to know who did what. All they'll know is that Trump is President and they have more money.",1
It comes down to lobbyists. Many congressmen are given money to campaign each year by insurance lobbyists and pharmaceutical lobbyists who will stop giving them money or worse give money to their adversaries in their district. Others are in districts who have opponents who are already given campaign money by these lobbyists who will be given even more money and support if they work against their best interests. Since universal healthcare would (likely) mean (much needed) regulation on the pharmaceutical industry and a massive cut for the health insurance industry they risk losing money.If the lobbyists refuse to do their job they are fired. If the corporations who hire these lobbyists refuse to give these orders they will lose profit. And if publically traded companies don't act in the best (monetary) interests of their shareholders? The shareholders will undoubtedly vote in a CEO/board who will (and can even sue those not working in the best interests of their investments).The politicians are stuck because they are afraid their opponents will be even worse for the country than they are. They might not have control over these issues but they still have some power. The CEOs are beholden to shareholders who are largely stock brokers who are legally bound to get the most money possible for their clients who rarely (if ever) look into or even know what stocks are in their portfolios. There are some independant stock owners who actually...take stock...in their companies but they are vastly outnumbered by big bank combined funds.,0
The first thing you have to understand about American politics is that the American electorate is shortsighted and stupid.  We would not have such awful politicians if we didn't have such an awful citizenry.  Unions are in tatters and often demonized so collective bargaining isn't in the zeitgeist at all.  People here are convinced there's no way for them to get more money from their employer and they shouldn't even try that the only way they can make more money is if they pay less taxes.Universal healthcare would by necessity involve the largest tax increase in US history.  That tax increase *should* be made up for by employers giving their employees the money that they currently spend on employee healthcare but US employees have no ability to conceive of their employers paying them more money so they have no ability to demand it.  This means that from their perspective a tax increase *that should save them money* is instead the evil Democrats taking their money away.  Even a lot of otherwise hardcore liberal voters in deep blue states believe this.Nobody has found a successful means of getting through to the people of this country that they deserve more money from their employers and have the ability to get it and that taxes are by and large good for them rather than bad.  You would need a blue supermajority Congress who were willing to torpedo their political careers in order to both pass universal healthcare and strongarm employers into giving that saved money to their employees because the employees aren't going to take it of their own volition.,0
> What the hell is wrong with the other two thirds...I think they will come around but the first group to stick their necks out are confident that voters from their home states are supportive.  If that sounds daft it is.  In the US we have a problem where right wing media have been telling lies to the people for decades about this issue.  I won't rehash all of it here but instead of looking at the many functioning models of public health care in the world a sizeable number of right leaning Americans have been convinced that we have some sort of free market exceptional model at work that needs preserving.  It is mind boggling really.,0
This is what I do not get about the USA. Other than roads and police services the tangible benefit of your taxes is often not seen by the common person.I'm not sure how people don't riot in the state's come tax season.  EDIT: Ok too many to reply to. I lived in America for a number of years though I am Canadian and moved back to Canada.That being said generally I see a lot of my taxes go towards all the things I care about. I have healthcare the social security and such programs work real well. The materity/paternity pay is great. The disability care is pretty good. Our education system is great as is our day care subsidies are good. Can it be better sure?In the USA in the state's I lived I've even had to pay an extra fee for having the fire department even have a chance to respond. Local community centers were massively underfunded. The amount of toll roads was insane.  The prisons are often for profit. The cost of community collages was far higher than Canada. The DMV run by the state was inefficient and often under staffed. Even the police were understaffed it felt like.It was my impression that all the taxes I paid went to nothing. That was just a feeling I got.In Canada at least I have the piece of mind that when a medical emergency comes up I can focus on my family and not my finances and paperwork. If nothing else that tangible benefit puts my mind at ease that my taxes are doing something.,0
Either:a) donã¢øt have health insurance so if something like Medicare For All became law you would now have health insurance and only pay an additional 1% on all income over $29000/year ã¢Î in your case thatã¢øs just $210 in additional taxes per **year**. Not to mention everyone else would also now have access to healthcare which is a very charitable endeavor.or b) you do have health insurance and would now pay considerably less than you did before ã¢Î in your case you would pay around $200 less than you did before assuming you had insurance through your employer. You would also be protected from losing your health insurance in the event you leave an employer with insurance as a benefit. This is a big deal for families who rely on a single family members employment status for their heath and wellbeing. Such a plan would a great thing for the economy over time.source: [Options to Finance Medicare For All](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all)Also if you really are paying $40-50k/year in taxes youã¢øre doing something seriously wrong. Not to mention youã¢øre already paying for Medicare/Medicaid both of which would go away with something like Medicare For All.,0
Uh...health care? Once the middle-man is removed we can have more people working administrative jobs directly in the health care system instead of all these middle-man positions (which is what private insurance has essentially become unwittingly or not). Here's a crazy idea: how about having more nurses with fewer hours? Why nurses have to work 10-14 hours at a time is insane to me: let's take all those lame paper-shuffling desk jobs and turn them into health care workers. Of course people have to make their own choices but that seems like a far more fulfilling position than approving insurance claims (and it probably pay more even with fewer hours). ,0
"It's bad economics (the wealthy did nothing to deserve higher taxes except get good at building wealth which oftentimes gets reinvested into the economy: good for everyone) but I understand that sentiment: it's good old fashion socialism. We could do this is a much more ""American"" (i.e. privately-managed) way but we've already been going down the ""universal"" route for so long (and have so many bureaucracies that manage health care for vast segments of society except people between 18-65 for the most part) that it seems inevitable at this point. I'm not thrilled (as a fiscal conservative) but Republicans have presented few other decent options. ",1
"Well ""single-payer"" and ""medicare for all"" might end up being surprisingly flexible terms if it makes political and practical sense for them to be it wouldn't be the craziest rhetorical trick American politics has pulled off in living memoryI think the making a case for a better plan/hashing out the details of how we make this work is what happens through the legislating process. Right now imho we need to make the case to lawmakers about *what* we want in a general sense once a bill has been introduced and is getting reviewed in committees and such we can drill in on *how* we get there exactly.",0
"Why do you support a commie? Here's what Trump published back in 2000 on Universal healthcare in his book ""America We Deserve"":>Today many Americans can't even get in their doctors' doors for the medical attention they need... HMOs and PPOs aren't working. Prescription medicine is hard to come by at a reasonable price. Medicare is suffering from immense financing problems.This breakdown in doctor-patient relations is caused by the growth of a new bureaucracy--the health insurance delivery system. American healthcare has a couple of toes in the grave despite the fact that our medical science is the most advanced on earth... And yet top-of-the-line American medical science is out of reach of most Americans.>The healthcare bureaucrats are depriving Americans of care in order to keep costs down. Medical care is so expensive in fact that millions of Americans have no health insurance at all.Here's the real scandal: According to James Frogue in a Heritage Foundation memorandum around ten million American children have no insurance coverage. This isn't to say they can't get medical attention--though some activists would have us think so--but they are often treated in hospital emergency rooms which is the most expensive type of care. Routine medical care for these kids often doesn't exist.>The structure of the healthcare industry is confusing and expensive at every level and there's no simple solution. Since the Truman administration our country has been trying to implement a system that protects all citizens.>I'm a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one. We should not hear so many stories of families ruined by healthcare expenses. We must not allow citizens with medical problems to go untreated because of financial problems or red tape. It is an unacceptable but accurate fact that the number of uninsured Americans has risen to forty-two million.Working out detailed plans will take time. But the goal should be clear: Our people are our greatest asset. We must take care of our own. We must have universal healthcare.>Just imagine the improved quality of life for our society as a whole if the issue of access to healthcare were dealt with imaginatively. With more than forty million Americans living day to day in the fear that an illness or injury will wipe out their savings or drag them into bankruptcy how can we truly engage in the ""pursuit of happiness"" as our Founders intended?UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE>What would universal care look like?>Nebraska senator Kerrey and others have advocated a version of the Canadian-style single-payer syste in which all payments for medical care made to a single agency (a opposed to the large number of HMOs and insurance companies with their diverse rules claim forms and deductibles). A recent study done by the Massachusetts Medical Society says that in Massachusetts the single-payer plan would save $5 billion or about one-seventh of the overhead spent on the medical care. Administrative costs across America make up 25 percent of the healthcare dollar which is two-and-a-half times the cost of healthcare administration in Canada. Doctors might be paid less than they are now as is the case in Canada but they would be bale to treat more patients because of the reduction in their paperwork.The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than Americans. There are fewer medical lawsuits less loss of labor to sickness and lower costs to companies paying for the medical care of their employees. If the program were in place in Massachusetts in 1999 it would have reduced administrative costs by $2.5 million.We need as a nation to reexamine the single-payer plan as many individual states are doing.",1
4 decades? Our modern economy is built on capitalism...it's not propaganda buddy. The only argument for socialized medicine that even passes the smell test (because socialism is bullshit: using other American's wealth without their consent is legalized theft plain and simple) is the fact that we have vast amounts of wealth in this country that are poorly allocated (by the government...not private individuals who should rightly pursue their own self interests). That fact is this will be a major burden on our economy but health care already was. We're caught between a rock and a hard place make no mistake about that. ,1
">How much will it save the private sector?You will be paying about 2.4% (give or take a few .%'s) increased taxes. On average that's about 500 to 1500 a year for most Americans.Now subtract what you're currently paying for healthcare. You're *already* saving money.Now imagine not paying copays out-of-pocket fees over-budget fees over-lifetime fees and no prescription fees. Now you're saving a whole lot more and you don't have to carry around health insurance cards or deal with shitty insurance companies.The effort alone is worth it. Insurance companies will be forced to adapt and CEO's will be forced to live with a few million $ less each month.>What about long term savings from having near universal coverage?Not ""near"" ""full"". This will cover literally everyone.>Is this enough to eventually bring our per capita spending to a level comparable to other first world nations?No because our system has a lot of stuff that needs to be taken care of but after renegotiation and other programs one day it might. It won't happen within the next presidential term but it may eventually happen (pending another Trump-esque president in the future).The per capita spending will inherently go down though.",0
>1) Given your other views getting to this is impressive.I'm not convinced universal healthcare is a good idea. But I think it's almost inevitable. Even Republicans are starting to support it.>2) It's as hard to get into this country as it's ever been certainly much tougher than your parents or grandparents faced.Legally? Yes. Illegally? Seems pretty easy.>3) More hungry kids can't follow you there. We've already got more than enough.No I agree. We've got to feed the kids once they exist. I'm just saying that it would be good to try to figure out some way of preventing people from having those kids in the first place. How? I don't know. But there are probably ways of tying welfare to lack of reproducing which would help.>4) Sure whatever. Americans are armed to the teeth. The idea that we have any effective gun control is laughable.But is that more because we don't have enough laws or because we don't have enough enforcement? In any case gun crime is mostly not committed by Republicans. I can understand them being miffed at being penalized for other people's criminality.>5) Violent crime is at all time lows pretty much everywhere.Yes but Democrats aren't gonna win many votes outside their existing base by standing up for violent criminals. They're also not helping the communities most affected by violent crime which are poor minority communities through these stances. They're just helping the criminal element in those communities.>6) Projecting power through foreign aid is much cheaper than projecting it militarily. There is a ton of fat in the military budget and it should be cut directly. But of course right wing media will treat this as the end of the world as they always do.I'd cut it if I could. But we agree on this matter - unfortunately it's a tough sell. It's not just the right-wingers who oppose such things. Obama wasn't exactly Mr. Peacenik. The Dems are not exactly an isolationist party.,0
Most Americans support something when they hear nothing but the flowers and rainbows and don't hear the potential negatives. We negotiate costs way down so hospitals and doctors go out of business. Hell there are plenty of hospitals going under NOW. Then you get the massive increase in demand and less access to the service. Average wait time in Canada is 17 weeks. Four months. Their specialist care isn't as good as ours. We don't even have a solid handle on what it would cost people. I don't know how much it would cost me and if it would be a net increase for me or not.  People haven't been faced with that. When they do you should prepare to see support go down. ,1
That's flat out false. It costs too much plain and simple. It will never work. What works for other countries won't always work for us. Only way to make it work is taxes going through the roof. We have 20 trillion dollars in debt so instead of making irrational policies and deciding where money that isn't ours should go we should instead focus on money we do HAVE not money we don't posess. There's people who've argued our debt is a massive threat to our national security. There is no money for this unless of course we just put it on the tax payers tab instead of legislators or senators pay for it themselves which will never happen. ,1
I don't care what the rest of those countries are doing. I don't live in those countries. I live in what is called The United States of America. Not Canada. Not Britain. Not Germany. Not France. Not Italy. Not any other country in the world. I live in The United States of America. This country is different than every single other country in the world. Our budgetary needs are different than every single other country in the world. I would like to see it work in a few states here in the United States of America before we implement an untested system across the entire United States of America which could have catastrophic budgetary effects. Is that too much to ask?,1
"> You have whole countries who are single payer. Also he's a senator he works in the federal government.Those countries aren't the US. You're comparing apples to oranges. Our budgets aren't the same not even close.>We have a ton of data on our healthcare system. If given enough time and effort the experts can get it right.Ok that's fine they can implement test projects on the state level first until they find something that works. Even Bernie's own state rejected his single payer proposal. *Not a single state* has something working. Why are we trying something that hasn't been tried and gotten to work in a single state here on the entire US? No. That's dumb.>ACA was gutted in the senate and was never going to work as it was designed.The ACA continued going vastly over budget and kept having to receive bailouts to keep going. There was no ""gutting"". That's what happens when you tell people ""you have to pass it to see what's in it"". They lied about the costs big time.>If the public option was included like how it was designed we would have seen a completely different outcome.Yeah if only they'd have figured out how to pay for that maybe it would have but they didn't.",1
">Well we have a tested system which is tantamount to crimes against humanityAre you kidding me? Do you know how much money the US spends on R&D? There is no country that comes even close. Not ANYWHERE close. Not even in the same ballpark. Not even in the same galaxy. China is second with 1/4 and the vast majority of their publications are literally copy/paste of American documentation. THAT is what you call a ""crime against humanity""? What in the fuck. Seriously I'm at a loss of words on how you could type something that is so false and disgustingly hyperbolic just to push your political agenda. Absolutely disgusting and you should feel bad.>Grow up and learn that life is unfairHow about you grow up and learn people don't work for free. People bring their talents to where they will get the most money for those talents. For many that's becoming a lawyer a doctor researcher etc. For someone who defends Technocracy you sure seem oblivious to the fact these people don't do this for free.

Completely laughable. >and private interests hate youThey don't hate you they just don't care about you unless you can contribute and by the looks of your posting history not only do you not contribute you'd seem like you'd be a person who does nothing but complain about everything at every turn possible.>All you 12-year-olds imposing your views on us is annoying.Rich coming from someone who attempts to spew insults about peoples moms on the same level as your average 12 year old XBox gamer.>It's pretty easy stuff...Obviously.

There was no one person who led the fight to legalizing gay marriage it was just this slow tide of more and more people realizing the undenialble truth of ""oh wait there's nothing wrong with gay people getting married"" and the same will happen here... more and more people will just realize ""oh wait ensuring everyone has healthcare is a good idea""",0
>Exactly why does Reddit fawn over this guy? On top of being a literal fucking communist two decades ago he also did a whole lot of shady shit during the primary and afterward.

I will fault him and his supporters for not accepting the reality that his socialism communism *would* have impacted him significantly in the general among older voters and older voters decide elections because young voters *don't show up.* As for the shady shit as for his dividing the party and staying in the race even though he was pretty much mathematically eliminated in *march.* And even as it was obvious the damage he would do in the general...

You remember? That mentality has never left and if that's something you experienced then I'm sorry for you. I don't think you took into consideration of how big of a loss it is to miss out on 8-10 years of job experience. While I'm in school still continuing my education the person who is already in the workforce has had numerous pay increases and promotions and is likely to be making just as much or even more than a physician. The wealthy are the minority who decide to go into private practice. Your not seeing that type of money working in a clinic or hospital. Again the path to medicine is long and rigorous. Every MD I know loves what they do salary the payoff for all the hard work.,1

"That won't happen.  We have broader coverage requirements without the same cutoffs.  In the US doctors are not allowed to overrule patient and family wishes in the context of medical futility.

Hospice no matter what the family wants.  Look at the recent situation in UK with  Charlie Gard:  his parents wanted to keep him alive despite medical futility (i.e. Tracheostomy PEG tube and life on a ventilator). The courts said no and forced a withdrawal of care on a child despite the parents wishes.   That will never happen here (Americans can't be told no when it comes to healthcare; their unalienable ""right"" to it and all).  If universal healthcare in the form of unlimited Medicaid for all happens it will bankrupt this country. ",1
That exactly the kind of thinking that killed millions in Russia. The farmers were great at producing food so naturally they became rich. The useless leeches of society felt this was unfair so they killed the successful farmers and took their land. Since they were useless they produced no food and millions starved. Those who didn't starve went hungry and suffered from malnutrition everyday waiting in bread lines. You have to remember a rich person got rich by giving something to the masses that they wanted. You kill all the givers and next thing you know there'll be nothing for you to take.If you don't learn from history you're bound to repeat it and most likely starve thanks to your own ignorance. Just say no kiddo.,1
This must also be accompanied by the reduction of healthcare provisions in other forms of insurance.  The costs of Property and auto insurance should reduce since the personal injury is no longer part of it.It would be a larger reach but the amount my employer says they pays for my healthcare should also be in consideration.  Since Medicare is infinitely lower cost a percentage should be moved into that tax and the balance should be added to my paycheck.The average uneducated viewer sees higher taxes but does not understand this should be a net gain to the average American.,1
"The savings will be statistical. Most will be better off. Some will be much better off. A few will be worse off. The problem is the republicans are the party of the anecdote. They will find some person that is paying more and that will be the next ""Joe the plumber"" figure that gets trotted out as an example of the government screwing people. The savings are also hidden in taxes. So your tax bill is higher but your not paying insurance premium directly. Also your tax bill is higher for your whole life while your insurance premiums start low and get higher with age. Many people will see higher taxes and not understand that on average over your life this is much cheaper than the old way. It's a hard sell and the difficulty is compounded by the fact that one party has no intention of making this a fact based intelligent discussion. ",0

They knew they wouldn't get their wish but by actively campaigning and voting for it (over and over again) they convinced the American public (Republicans anyway) that it was an important issue that needed to be a focus of future elections.And now they can't repeal or replace the ACA because they never developed a workable plan beyond campaign slogans.  Democrats should be wary of falling into the same trap.  This is a great start but they need to refine the policy and the messaging.  Far too many people seem to believe that single payer is inevitable because it's the best policy and it's popular. But there is no real workable policy yet and it will be extremely difficult to maintain public support once the attacks begin.,1
It'd be interesting to propose as an opt-in - you can jump into it if you want and be taxed accordingly or stick to private plans.  Let the market decide which is better.  Even if it cost me a little more I would join to support the cause and simplify the miserable billing process and coverage anxiety.  I don't think Medicare could be reliably ramped up to the entire population in one year anyway.Then there's the old burn and pillage form of rolling it out - government seizes the health insurance industry and trims out the bullshit.  Use the former insurance employees as new government employees and get rid of the overpaid execs that think they can do better elsewhere.,0
"How is it unrealistic to extend medicare to everyone?You learned the wrong lesson from 2016. The lesson is that people are tired of neoliberal policies which tell the working class that they have to be crushed by pro-corporate policies. If the working class demands to no longer be exploited pro-corporate democrats will say ""Oh please. Don't be so unrealistic. Your anti-corporate policies will never pass"".If history shows us anything it's that politicians don't change society via ruthless pragmatism. Mass movements change politicians due to fear of upsetting the status quo.With a mass movement we can take on the private insurance industry. ",0
"> Polling for universal healthcare is higher than it's ever been.After Hillary retired from SoS and before she entered the primary there were polls that said she was the most popular politician in America; by October she was the second least popular presidential candidate in polling history. Or another example: during the primary as Hillary basically refused to articulate any real criticism of Bernie for fear of losing his voters there were even polls that said Bernie could beat Trump. Polling for anything will be high if the public is only exposed to the For argument and never the Against argument. You can't pass healthcare by stealth. The Against argument WILL be articulated and when it is people will decide they don't want ""Medicare For Me.""",0
And if enough people opt-out of those insurance companies in favor of the public option insurance companies will be forced to change their plans and renegotiate their deals with doctors. The end result is that some people won't be able to keep their plan or their doctor and they'll rage that universal healthcare is to blame and should be abolished.Telling people that they can keep their plan or their doctor is not a promise the government can make because it's not under their control. Insurance companies decide what plans they offer and doctors or medical facilities decide what insurance they accept.,0
