# redditBotAnalysis

Bots posing as real users on social media can artificially influence public perception. To combat this, the Reddit API, machine learning, and the Levenshtein distance algorithm were used to determine the overall likelihood of a thread being overrun with bots.

Currently only working with one Reddit comment thread as a test case for HackNY Spring 2018 Hackathon. Winner of Most Technical Hack award.
