As a Canadian it always blows my kind whenever I read the debate about healthcare in America. I want to share my experience with appendicitis that happened about a month ago. Woke up in terrible pain in my lower right side called telehealth (free Ontario nurses who can help diagnose you) and was told to go for the ER. Went there got registered as a patient and it took about 6hrs for me to be diagnosed (scans blood urine results). I was in surgery within an hour. They kept me over night. I was told I could leave about 24hr after I arrived there the previous day. The only papers I was given were post surgery advice and couple signatures before surgery for liability reasons. Paid $15 for pain medication at the pharmacy. No bills. ,
To everyone complaining about their taxes going up or whatever you never know when something catastrophic could happen to you or your family.My dad was a healthy 45 year old who one day got a sinus infection that turned into bronchitis that turned into asthma/COPV and some mystery illness. He stayed sick for 15 years until he died.After a couple of years he had to quit his job because he worked with the public and he couldn't stand the smell of women's perfume without having an asthma attack the kind that would send you to the ER.So we lost half of our income while our medical bills went through the roof; we were going to the ER at least twice a month sometimes staying in ICU. Between the hospital visits doctor visits and prescription drug costs we almost lost our house and went bankrupt. Both my mom and my dad just had basic jobs that didn't require a college degree.This practically happened overnight. The doctors never figured out what the mystery illness was but my dad was too sick to go to his own mother's funeral.Granted this was before the ACA so I don't know how that would have changed things but we had my mom's insurance and still almost lost everything. Only family stepping in and helping with groceries and bills saved us.It was a nightmare. Something has to change.,
>that same survey found that when respondents were told that a universal healthcare plan might give the government ‰ÛÏtoo much control‰Ûù or that it might increases taxes opposition spiked from 43% to 62% and 60% respectively ‰ÛÒ perhaps a sign of the major political and policy fights that lie aheadI'm continually amazed and disappointed at how many people have been conditioned to believe that government administration is inherently tyrannical. In the case of healthcare it's not the *government* which makes it tyrannical it's the *profit motive*. The government isn't going to screw people and deny services so some bigwigs can make a fortune. But insurance companies *will*.,
When it comes to bills like this there will always be compromise. Why do you think Obamacare became washed down socialized health care? Even in the hypothetical future the Dems will still need some R support for an eventual healthcare bill. Bills this large cant get by without at least some level of bipartisanship. Some of the stuff in this bill simply will not ever be signed off on by the GOP. Even if the GOP sides with public opinion on Universal Healthcare some time in the future I cant see them folding on their tax philosophy. Thats why I feel arguably the most controversial aspect of this bill is the tax hike on people making over 250k.  ,
Why do people get excited about the tax cost Medicare for All would impose? Do people not realize that their insurance premiums are just as much if not more than a MFA tax? Right now I have a shitty HSA for my son and I and that still costs me $180 per check and I basically have nothing to show for it but catastrophic coverage. I pay everything else out of pocket until I hit my $5k deductible. I could pay about 10-15% in MFA taxes end up at my same take home pay AND I WOULD HAVE VASTLY BETTER INSURANCE COVERAGE.I have fucked up shoulders that need help but I'm not able to afford the out of pocket costs or the MRI and subsequent PT/surg I would need in order to fix my shoulders. It's so fucked that I along with basically all other Americans can't go and get the help we need because it's simply too expensive. AND THAT'S WITH INSURANCE!!!We need to get the fuck off private insurance and begging a ground to ceiling medical reform initiative in this country. Our medical access is fucking garbage. ,
I think this has to be the end goal but even as someone who believes that and who loves Bernie I think Murphy's plan might be the better option for right now. It's essentially a public option allowing people to buy into Medicare (likely for cheaper than most private options). The hope would be that as more and more people just move to Medicare on their own and like it it makes single payer much easier to sell. Plus shouldn't be much reason for republicans to oppose it - they always claim to be about choice and options this is just another option.The obvious downside is it doesn't get us to full coverage until however long it takes to eventually transitition to single payer and that's an issue. I haven't yet read Bernie's bill but I've read a couple summaries and both said it's vague on how it will be paid for which I kind of expected. ,
This needs to happen. My daughter just got out of the hospital (she is doing well - not looking for sympathy). It was a children's hospital and it was a soul crushing experience. Not just because of what my teen daughter had to go through but seeing and hearing these kids some of them tiny babies in such pain. We are lucky I have great insurance. I pay $1000.00 a month for it but luckily I can afford that. We were in the hospital for about 3 weeks I saw many families come and go and found myself wondering how many of them would experience the relief of having their child well again dampened by the depression of having astronomical bills that they can't afford. That shouldn't happen in the richest country in history. It is criminal.,

"The country is still much better off accepting the fact that today far more people like the PPACA then they did when it was passed.  The very foundation of it is Republican in concept (Heritage Foundation).Single Payer is never going to really work because the government grossly overpays for everything it buys. Moreover this is a country that can't properly take care of their own veterans...what makes ANYONE think they can take care of everyone?The reality for me is Republicans need to accept the reality that ""Obamacare"" is a far better solution than Trumpcare (which would send tens of millions to uninsured - ergo just recreating the problem we had before Obamacare) and it's far better than expecting the government to accurately provide health care for 320 million people.  Having the government actively oversee and coordinate private industry insurers....putting reasonable price controls in place and providing need based credits so EVERYONE is insured by private industry is the most efficient solution to the problem.  The PPACA needs significant repairs but the guts of it are the best compromise solution there is.Unfortunately neither side gets it.",
"Some easy ways to cut other costs to help pay for such a system:    - Cut insane military spending. So much of what we spend tax dollars on is bloated obsolete overkill nonsense leftover from the WWII/Cold War era. How many nuclear missiles do we really need? Bombers? Fighter jets? And so on. It's absurd.   - End the ""war on drugs"" (I seem to recall that we learned at some point in the past that prohibition does not work) and tax and regulate the various banned substances that costs us a ton in policing and imprisonment. I'd rather my tax dollars be spent on improving the health and happiness of myself and my fellow citizens than on either of those two harmful and outrageously expensive endeavors. ",
Though I respect and completely agree with Senator Sanders in that United States NEEDS universal healthcare.  It is long overdue it is something that is workable in real life and not modeled in a computer simulation.  There are plenty of Countries in which to study how it is applied and administered in their Country.  Canada comes to mind.That being said this sub is sounding more and more an echo chamber with nobody chiming in playing the devils advocate.  There is a lot of hard work and a long rough road that lie ahead but this needs to be debated openly and discussed with respect.  We need to populate this discussion with others with opposite opinion that make a compelling argument for their side.,
If Democrats want to win here's what I think might work:1) Universal healthcare yes... but also:  2) More restrictive immigration controls. People would be more ready to buy into Democrat wealth redistribution programs if Democrats didn't also support bringing more low-skilled workers into the country.  3) A rethink of welfare when it comes to what it incentivizes people to do. Put forward some ideas for how to continue providing welfare but in such a way that it discourages welfare recipients from having kids.  4) Less emphasis on gun control. Law-abiding gun owners don't want to be punished for what law-breaking gun owners do.  5) Get tougher on violent crime but without increased police authoritarianism. Democrats have a tendency to make too many excuses for violent criminals. If Democrats advocate for better policing but put forward ways to achieve this without giving police more draconian powers they could win with multiple constituencies.6) Military spending cuts would be a good idea in my opinion but the problem is that most people have very little understanding of military realities and it is easy to fearmonger claiming that such spending cuts would significantly damage US security even if they wouldn't. Democrats might be able to make some headway on the issue by emphasizing foreign aid cuts and cuts packaged as attempts to increase efficiency. Unfortunately a too-direct attempt to tackle the issue might cause ill-informed people to react in fear as if the nation was being made less safe.,
Look instead of making Medicare mandatory for everyone why not just open it up as something that people can buy into? Everyone has a Medicare deduction come out of their paycheck now (or if self-employed they pay into it yearly)... why not just make it an option to double your contribution to and then you'll be on it as a primary insurance? You can still buy supplemental private insurance through your employer or on the open market to fill the inevitable deductible gaps (as a lot of senior citizens do now) but your catastrophic coverage is guaranteed.I don't see how this is rocket science. The additional payroll contributions should go a long way in paying for the additional expenses.,
I know I'm going to be downvoted but whatever. This is the same typical hot air from Sanders. His big head is so full of it I'm surprised he hasn't floated away. There's no chance this bill will actually be voted on by the Senate let alone pass. This is political branding nothing more. He's trying to portray himself as some crusader of the people while simultaneously accomplishing absolutely nothing. This is political grandstanding to a minority of Americans who already make up his base. It's not reaching out to anyone new and he knows he won't be held accountable to his promises because it's never going to become a reality anyway. He can say whatever he wants and the people will eat it up. This is no different than Trump spewing bullshit and his supporters lapping it up because it's what they *want* to hear.,
That's cool. Did he introduce it on the state level first to see if the plan is viable? If it's so much cheaper then obviously it would be a gigantic hit and all the states would just implement it themselves right?No?So basically he wants a completely untested system being implemented nation wide that could very well bankrupt the entire nation? Awesome!As an independent sick of both parties I'm going to have to say no. States are meant to be a testing grounds for this kind of thing. If not a single state is willing to try it themselves...why should be force it on the entire nation? If the voters of a single state don't find it attractive enough why are we attempting to force it on the entire nation? Make it work on the state level first. Until then I can not vote for any person that advocates for nationalized healthcare. I want to see it successfully implemented in at least ONE state before forcing it on all of us.,
>The new system would be underwritten by an increase in taxes.this is where you lose my approval.  There is NO NEED FOR A TAX INCREASE TO PAY FOR SINGLE PAYER CARE.We spend 10s of BILLIONS a year on military.  We send BILLIONS a year to other countries for military aid.  We send BILLIONS MORE to other countries and companies for subsidies.Want my support?  Fix the spending and re-apply appropriate fiscal budgets to the healthcare issue.FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.Raising taxes on an already over taxed country to pay for a program that should already be budgeted is fucking ridiculous.,
"This won't pass. There are too many problems with it and I'm all for single-payer. First and foremost -  Nobody wants increased taxes. The statement that ""Companies currently paying your premium will now be able to boost your wages"" is laughably unrealistic. No these companies will give that money right to their shareholders. You're going to have to convince people that the increased taxes offset the decrease in insurance spending. To really fix our healthcare system you're going to have to break a lot of things and rebuild from the ground.There are simply too many health insurance companies and hospitals that rely on our overly complex and bureaucratic maze of a system to extract profit from customers. The people in health insurance companies millions of employees in total will be out of a job. More importantly for the success of this legislation is that these companies will cease to exist. They will fight tooth and nail to protect themselves.Ultimately I do believe universal healthcare is possible but we first need to completely re-engineer the healthcare system. We need to get rid of the existing Medicare/medicaid alongside with private insurance and build a new system that accurately reflects costs. Hospitals are directly responsible for this. So long as they continue to charge insanely overpriced fees to the government and private insurance companies we will never be able to get rid of our current system. IF and that's a huuuuge if hospitals agree to set prices of procedures and goods to a realistic price this would be the first step of many. Next you'd have to deal with multi-billion dollar private health insurance companies facing extinction and somehow compensate for the economic impact of billions of dollars fleeing from capital markets and millions of employees finding themselves unemployed.Finally you'd have to find a way to get around the private sector using health insurance as a way to retain their employees. Again you're dealing with lobbyists with a vested interest in the status quo and deep pockets to keep it. If you can convince corporate America that they're better off not having the competitive advantage of employer-provided healthcare then you might just get away with it.All these things together present a near insurmountable hurdle. Our system is clearly and undeniably inferior to single payer in other first world nations but the amount of work we'd have to undergo to fix it would cause so much grief and divide that it really comes down to whether or not its survivable without fracturing the nation.TL;DR: Raising taxes and expanding govt-subsidized healthcare won't work. Healthcare as a right needs to be built from the ground up as a new system. That means that the old system will have to die a painful death that will wreak economic havoc. I don't think we're capable as a nation of opening wounds like that. I hope I'm wrong.",
>During the first year of the program the eligibility age for the Medicare program would drop to 55 and all Americans under 18 would be added to the program. The eligibility age would gradually decrease until the fourth year when everyone would receive a ‰ÛÏuniversal Medicare card‰Ûù.And money won't be going to CHIP and Medicaid for those under 18 or for seniors (Medicaid). This is why he ran. He wanted to build support. The thing that drives me crazy is people act like they have zero creativity when discussing this stuff. They talk about taxes going up and how half the population will get it free off the backs of others because they don't pay any taxes. But it doesn't have to be that way. They could design the program so that you pay your Medicare for All premium whether you owe taxes or not or at least a portion of it. If you receive some other form of government assistance it could be deducted from that prior to disbursement. ,

Will the Medicare for All bill (and subsequent bills cover)1. Health Insurance worker compensation (3-5 Million Unemployed Rest folded into government another government cost)2. Reduction of Pharmacy and Medication cost which will result in excuse by Pharma Bosses to reduce worker force3. Reduction of Hospital Costs which will reduce hospital staff4. Reduction in Physician salaries which are among the highest in the world. **in USA avg. Salary of Physician in  2008 was $186582 versus $125000 in Canada $159000 in Britain and just $92000 in Australia* The gap is believed to be even higher now in 2016.Not only will this be a Medicare for all bill this will cut the entire healthcare industry (which have jobs) for much lesser healthcare industry in SIZE but it will give the start to begin taxing people to cover the remaining cost after all the slashes to overhead mentioned above is done.,
>Standing in opposition to Sanders‰Ûª plan are what he calls the ‰ÛÏmost powerful and greedy forces in American society‰Ûù: the pharmaceutical industry insurance companies Wall Street and the Republican party.Pharmaceutical companies are actually in favor of a system like this.

Decriminalize Marijuana and other drugs as well and you'll quickly see healthcare costs drop drastically as medicine that normally cost hundreds of dollars per pill drops down to a few bucks.,

Has Bernie ever presented any kind of timeline he thinks this could get done in? I'm worried that when it doesn't pass the first couple times that people will lose hope and get apathetic. I'd like to know what he plans to do about that especially since he is rather old and won't be around to save us forever. It's not like he has a prodigy that will take over for him and clearly liberals are lacking leaders they really like. Beyond just sticking with a push for Single Payer how do you keep people interested when they get their hopes up and then get disappointed some because I'm pretty sure that will happen at least for awhile. We aren't going to go from Trump to Single Payer in 4 years and even 8 seems like a short time for that much of a swing. I think it's possible in 6-8 but not 4. AND It's only possible if liberals vote like they mean it for 6 years in a row three BIG elections and all the little ones in between! YOU CAN DO IT! However I want Bernie to tell you that.How will he fight the potentially long fight that this will take without losing support for not getting it passed in 2 or 4 years? That's really always been the question with his big promises HOW and WHEN and HOW! How can anybody keep liberals motivated to vote! They love to dream big and they love to embrace apathy when they don't get what they want. It doesn't seem like it will be easy. We need more charismatic liberal leaders.,
"It would actually be really bad if it passes since it's not a complete bill. Much like every past time Bernie has pushed a bill like that it hasn't included how to pay for the change and all the other details needed to make an actual Medicare for all system.There's a reason why the ACA was over 300 pages long. It needed to be to properly outline how to have a healthcare system and cover all the things needed in that topic. If Bernie's current bill passed it would basically be a ""healthcare system"" with nothing to actually enact it with. And I certainly hope Republicans don't try to pull a bait and switch where they pass Bernie's bill as a way to get rid of the ACA without having to do anything else.•ÈÀ",
Honestly I'm getting a little frustrated at sanders here if you want this to be a meaningful discussion on how to do healthcare you need your bill to be costed. If it isn't it just doesn't matter. How much will this plan cost where will that money be raised what happens to the tens of thousands of americans who work in Health insurance offices what do we do to ensure that the doctors are not overbooked when appointments are free and there is no barrier to use.  I want to see you guys get Single payer it is where you need to go but we need to talk seriously about how you cross the crocodile infested waters between here and there. If you want to tax the rich fine but you need details how much money needs to be raised 1 trillion? 2? 1.346 trillion? If so what kind of tax rate increase does that represent on corporation tax on estate tax etc. Is it 8% increase in income tax for the top 10% of earners is it 9.5%?    This plan has symbolic value it may even have campaign value in 2020 but it leaves so many unanswered questions :/ ,
**Couple questions**1) 1/3 of the funding is estimated to come from the states how in the world is the federal government going to convince 34-35 Republican governors to sign such a law?* Also 69/99 state legislature are Republican controlled* Most states have a 60% vote threshold for passing a large tax hike which makes it harder.2) How is Sanders plan going to get doctors to join the public system when they are paid much less?* I ask because Sanders during the primaries said he would make it part of the law doctors have to see public option people this would be a SCOTUS challenge and I don't see even Liberal justices like Kegan or Byer supporting that3) Colorado had a referendum for the basic level universal system and it failed 80%-20% so how are they going to convince people?4) To pass a law like this would take 60 votes in the senate and I don't see Republicans and even moderate Democrats supporting this.,
"Show the Numbers THE REAL NUMBERS.  Because every time this crackpot waves his hands around and talks about this concept he acts like the rich in this country are hiding the magical money tree.   There is a reason that even California abandoned single payer.  It's untenable.  His ""plan"" during the 2016 Primaries would have cost somewhere between 18-35 Trillion Dollars and you aren't getting that money from the 1% that's coming straight from the Middle Class and Small Businesses.  It's ruinous it's ludicrous and it's idiotic but so is Socialism and every idiot on the Internet likes to pretend that ""if we just did it right"" we wouldn't become the next Soviet Union or Venezuela (we would) because somehow we are more like the thinly populated culturally homogenous Nordic States (we aren't) than we are those to failed states.  ",
We have 50 states each one very different try 50 different plans? Learn from each? Doesn't that make sense? Vermont has only 642000 residents California almost 40 million. Just seems like the logical approach to me. What works share what does not work discard. How successful organizations are built.Still don't understand why a region like Brooklyn of 3 million-plus residents does not run their own plan. Just remove the insurance companies from the equation. Charge $100 a month per resident make everyone a shareholder. That's $300M a month you can move mountains with that kind of cash. You can build your own big pharm labs hire top talent modernize hospitals send kids to Medical School. We have the internet we have the cloud hospital IT is stuck in 1997.I WANT my healthcare records seen crowd source my MRI's. Everyone can see my Venmo transaction I don't really care. If you want to lock down your personal records fine but give me a choice.Healthcare needs to be disrupted. It's time.Source: Bernie supporter,

If by some chance he succeeds in spending our cash to keep everyone healthy then what will our tax be to keep everyone alive after 70 then 80 then 90?  What did I miss?  I thought there were only two guarantees in life and dying was one of them.  How about we take the other approach.  We eat right don't kill ourselves with drugs and alcohol and if our genes are so fuck up we shouldn't breed then live life fast and die.  Just don't fucking bread.  The fact that we have to spend every fucking penny on ensuring that each and every person lives ten seconds longer than they should simply means that we've forgotten there is an afterlife and perhaps they should be panicking.,
"From what I read from several sources (CNN CBS some outlets I can't remember off the top of my head); they're updating Sander's bill from 2008 and taking the House Bill into account since only that chamber can approve spending.HR 676: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/SR 1723 introduced in 2007: https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/3413/textI should mention this is more of a proposal instead of some several hundred page behemoth that'll cover the intricacies. Everything isn't outlined it's not gone through the ""process"" of stuffing riders and the nuts and bolts but it gives an idea.They might just scrap those two and come up with a new one altogether but seeing how it's the same sponsor and the house has one in the process you can probably piece it together.**EDIT** I think the proposal if it passes is meant to get traction on the system being set-up. As in giving them a timeline. I could be wrong though I am very tired and may have misread a few things.",
"I don't think so.  And it might not even be fully released when he officially unveils it.  And it's important to be able to read the thing before we get behind it because the most important thing won't be in the five minute stump speech that Sanders prepares.  The big question is does it ban competing health care plans from private companies?  If not ""Medicare for All"" is an option and it will be something great for Democrats to rally around and something that will be hard for Republicans to make a case against.  It will be popular because people will be able to make a choice. If it does ban competing private health care plans like the Conyers Bill ""Medicare for All"" is a mandate and this will be a huge boondoggle that will ensnare all branches of government and will make passing Obamacare look like passing a House Resolution proclaiming ""America is Awesome!"".  ",
"When it comes to healthcare politics there are 3 groups on Reddit 1. People who **don't remember shit**2. People who **remember how hard ACA was**3. People who **remember how hard ACA was** and **how Hillarycare failed**Everyone reading this should take a second to HONESTLY grade yourself. What group are you in? There's necessarily an age factor here. You'd need to be 35 to have been 12 when Hillarycare went down to defeat. So dear reader: are you 35? 25? 20? or are you a 17 year old who spent last April photoshopping that sparrow that landed on Bernie's podium and downvoting everyone who said he wouldn't win 60% of the delegates from New York?The utmost concession to reality ever offered by Group-1-ers is ""sure we can't do it now but give us a filibuster proof majority and a D President in a few years and we'll do it."" In other words they think that **AT WORST** this is going to be as hard a fight as ACA. That's totally wrong. There's a reason ACA didn't have Harry and Louise ads run against it. it's because every stakeholder in the healthcare lobby knew they had to be on board the bus or get run over by the bus; at the same time the Democratic Congress did not include certain policies (like the public option) because they feared that those stakeholders would be pushed into an existential fight for existence.(If you're wondering ""What are Harry and Louise ads?"" you're *so* in group 1)We need a single payer healthcare insurance program in America but ""Medicare For All"" is not a real plan. It's a rhetorical pivot like the way Frank Luntz rebranded the estate tax as the ""death tax"" to make it easier to fight. People only glommed onto ""Medicare for all"" because they think it'll make it easier to ""sell"" SPH to ""the dumb rubes"" but that is not the way politics works. If you think that you don't remember the town halls of August 2009. You cannot just remake the American economy with a slogan and expect to withstand scrutiny. What you need is a plan with an online calculator where anyone can go online enter their family's income and economic data and compare their tax increase vis-a-vis putative healthcare savings. None of these BUT IT SHOULD BE A RIGHT slogans actually create a plan that delivers this political *sine qua non*. That's why indeed the Bookers and Harrises of the Senate are only signing onto this symbolically and if we ever get a majority again while Bernie lives he and his repeal-and-replace-of-the-iconoclast-left will get left. Senator Sanders had a chance during the primary to put out a healthcare plan and he finally released a six page color pamphlet that was [eviscerated by left-leaning economists](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/us/politics/left-leaning-economists-question-cost-of-bernie-sanderss-plans.html?mcubz=0) who had [nothing to do with the Hillary campaign](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-bernie-sanderss-health-care-plan-leaves-out). In particular the planned prescription drugs *savings* were larger than the total America *spends* on prescription drugs. Imagine if I told you I can sell you an amazing car that's so affordable because it will save you $450 a month on gas. ""But I only spend $390 a month on gas!"" you say. ""NEOLIBERAL HILLSHILL"" you reply. That was the Democratic primary in a nutshell.",
And we were headed there *before reddit knew who bernie was* too... which is why it bothers me that he's given all the credit. What about Obamacare which laid the groundwork for expanded health coverage? What about Hillary Clinton's push for universal care in the 90s? What about LBJ's push for it in the 60s? And FDR's push for it in the 30s? Bernie didn't invent not did he even popularize the concept of universal healthcare or single payer he just introduced it to a particular group of politically apathetic millenials who would have known about it earlier had they been paying any attention to politics before Bernie ran. ,
It is where we are headed but it's going to be more than several years.  We have a long way to go and we need to make smaller steps (public option) first.  Even a democratic congress with a filibuster-proof majority isn't going to pass single payer in the next several years or the next decade.  There is of course the lobbyist and campaign finance issue but it would also put 460000 people out of work overnight... and these are people with pretty good jobs.If we want single payer to happen we need to focus on things that are achievable in the near future that move us in that direction.  The big goals become achievable when they aren't so far away and when the shock to the economy wouldn't be so large. It's great that these senators have made their wishes known but this is the practical equivalent of all of those votes to repeal Obamacare - they are doing it because they know that it isn't going to be passed anytime soon. ,
"Democrats have been pushing for UHC for over half a century now.  And they've made progress but it's been hard fought and there's a long way still to go.  Today's stunt doesn't move us any closer and a realistic timeframe is more likely measured in decades than years.Remember: to even pass it you'll need a solid majority of the House 60 votes in the Senate and a Democratic President.  And all of them will have to agree to a specific plan one where there will be real winners and losers not just an aspirational outline that glosses over every single difficult decision.And you're going to have to sell that plan to a wide majority of the public.  Because if you try to ""solve"" healthcare in a partisan manner you're going to end up handing the GOP base red meat to invoke a wave election to dismantle it just like what happened after the ACA passed.  If you want real and lasting change you're going to have to convince a large swath of the nation to support it.",
How are they doing to curtail the ridiculous costs in the current system? One ER visit for some stitches cost my friend a bill of $9000. Not kidding. With a medical mafia like that how does pushing those ridiculous costs to the government solve anything ? I believe the first order of things is to establish a framework for medical costs before this can be tackled at scale. I don't support paying a lot more taxes to cover this insanity that is our current medical establishment.I don't remember a single occasion with any hospital where the costs seemed in line with the procedure. They seem to be designed to extract/negotiate the maximum money from the insurers.,
As an American it blew my mind when I went to Ontario to visit my uncle who was hospitalized last year. I think he collapsed at home due to stomach ulcers and was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. He had surgery there and stayed at the hospital for 10 days. I went to the billing office to ask on his behalf what his bill would look like. There was no line and the lady basically like if he had his OHIP card with him he's all good for his hospital fees he only has to pay $45 for his ambulance. That was shocking. My aunt here in the US once took herself to the hospital and they took a look at her and said oh she should've gone to the building next door then proceeded to strap her into a stretcher stuff her into an ambulance drove her next door and charged her close to $1K for the ambulance fee only. She said afterwards if she had known she would've walked over instead lol. I don't know how much they charged her for treatment but I wouldn't be surprised if it were $10k or more. It's ridiculous. Something is just really wrong.,
Haha $15 for pain medication. This reminds me of the time I got sick on vacation in London. I visited an NHS clinic and was seriously shocked when I stepped out of the doctor's office and did not immediately encounter a secretary's desk with a credit card machine. I almost walked back up the receptionist to inquire about how I was supposed to pay before I realized I was *not* supposed to pay. It still almost felt wrong just walking out like I was pulling a fast one or something. Then I took my prescription to the pharmacy and this time I knew there would be no completely free drugs. So I did some googling and determined that my health insurer was in network with some foreign pharmacies. I mentioned this to the pharmacist and she very professionally walked me through the process for submitting that claim and then subtly suggested without mocking me that the medicine would only cost $8 if I just paid cash. My co-pay on insurance for drugs was $15 anyway. I wish I could read my own story from the perspective of a Brit just to see how insane it sounds.,
"Just an added little note - going to the ER in the US would also probably take about 6 hours on a good day. I'm just saying that because the ""wait time"" flag is always raised whenever people try to downgrade the Canadian system. So - you had the same time in the ER as the average American on a good day AND you didn't need to pay for the visit AND you did not have to pay one or two thousand $$ a month for your insurance plan.We are literally the stupidest people in the universe if we don't adopt a similar system. (I mean we've already proven ourselves to be insanely stupid this year but on top of that).",
This sounds amazing. Compare this with the typical american experience: Have a problem call to schedule an appointment with whatever doctor you think might be best. Better hope they accept your insurance. Wait 3-6 months before you can go in if you're a new patient (this drops down to anywhere between a week and 3 months if you're a recurring patient). Go in fill out a bunch of paperwork make sure you write down and share all of the insurance info your ID etc. Wait several hours before you can see the doctor. Doctor prescribes blood test and tells you to come back in a week/month/whatever. The fee is $100-200 but you got 'insurance' so you don't see this price tag until 1-2 months later. Your insurance naturally denies all the claims and sends you a bill for the full amount.You go get your blood test done doing the exact same process. Luckily this time you can walk in immediately (waiting for the rest of the people there). Forms insurance id then get your blood test. This costs anywhere from $100-2000 depending on what's done. Possibly more. Insurance is billed like the gods they are. 1-2 months later you find your insurance company has yet again denied paying and forwarded the bill for the full amount to you.After 1-3 months you go back to your doctor following the exact same process as the first time (fortunately no paperwork this time). Again wait a few hours after the scheduled time and you finally have your doctor prescribe what you need. You live insurance is billed for $100-200 and in typical fashion they forward you the bill. You will do this every 1-4 months for the duration that you're on the pills.So you go to fill out the prescription. Repeat until you find a pharmacy that doesn't charge you $100-400 for pills: Show insurance/id and prescription wait 5-10 minutes for them to tell you your insurance doesn't cover it. Hope to god it's cheap. At best pay $5 for each at worst pay hundreds. Wait 20 minutes while prescription is filled. Pay the amount and leave. Pills acquired.No clue how surgery and hospitals work but I can only imagine it's hell if this is how regular doctor visits are.,
"I think the sponsors of the bill need to heavily push a message that this is the ""replace"" promised by republicans. They need to hammer it in that this is how you ""get rid of Obamacare and get people affordable healthcare."" Use the terminology of the republican promises to justify the bill. That will make it far harder for the republicans in power who want to squash it to justify their positions.It will also make for great talking points in future elections. Anyone against universal healthcare should be facing challenges. They should have their feet held to the fire for why they want to preserve a broken system.",
Wouldn't need to raise taxes if we shifted most of the funds spent on the current welfare state (especially social security which is a useless poorly crafted retirement program) to a universal health care system. It's about priorities: people can get jobs in this economy just fine (unemployment is incredibly low right now). Being healthy and well is far more important than having the government help pay for your housing (or subsidize your food bill...cut back on the fancy meats and avocado toast folks!). We have to have priorities: not everything can have money thrown at it at the same time. ,
"I will work and vote to make sure this ""goal"" never happens.I understand the potential cost savings etc. but I am philosophically opposed to the government having its hands in every facet of life. The federal government has already grown far far too big already and needs to be reigned in.In fact ""Medicare for All"" sounds downright evil to me because CMS's reimbursement rates are so low and demands so high that health systems could not stay in business on government payors alone right now. Recent regulations have made it so that private physician practices have had to sell to large health systems in order to remain compliant.I would much rather pay a little more per year for my excellent coverage.What I would like to see is for the multinational pharmaceutical market to open up. That would be a huge help in driving down US health care costs.",
"No one is even suggesting somehow outlawing private health care or insurance. I'm Swedish we already have universal healthcare but I have private health/accident insurance *as well* because it's affordable and it makes sense. And I don't eat the argument about raising taxes. For those for whom Medicare for all would replace private health insurance the raised taxes would be lower than the cost of the insurance quite likely and because *everyone* would be covered there wouldn't even be anyone who could say ""they raise my taxes and I get nothing for it"". You get cheaper guaranteed health insurance. It's time America. In fact it's way past time already. ",
I think this would be a much more realistic and safer approach. What I find strange with all of these discussions is that single payer is equated with universal healthcare when there are in fact several other systems out there which reach the same goal while being more likely to work in the American environment. For instance Australia or Germany's public and private system or Switzerland's fully private but highly regulated system. They are not single payer but work well if not better than single payer systems like Canada's. I do not think single payer Medicare-for-all will ever pass and for good reason. Erasing such a big segment of the US economy will have drastic consequences. Plus I do not think that the average American would support such a system. We have it in our mindset that if you have the money you should be able to buy better care and I see nothing wrong with this. But there should definitely still be universal access to care. I just do not agree that single payer is the best way for the US to achieve that goal.,
"Im so sorry to hear about your father. I can't imagine what it's like to go through something like that. This healthcare system is fucked on so many levels. A guy that I work with had a reasonable (but not perfect) healthcare plan through his wife's job. She got diagnosed with cancer a couple of years ago and had to stop working because of it. She (and he) then lost her health insurance right when she needed it the most which became an enormous financial burden. She passed away almost a year later and my friend/colleague was then left with a huge amount of debt and is now considered single in terms of taxes which has fucked him over even further (which is a whole thing in and of itself.) It just sucks so much and it's so hard seeing other countries that are less wealthy than the US having systems that seem fairly functional that don't drive people into bankruptcy while we're here paying for these fucking wars all over the world. We have no problem paying for the war on terror or the war on drugs which show virtually NO results meanwhile we have people sick and dying here. In Bernie's words ""We can do better.""",
Simply a bad idea to raise capital gains: hurting investments to keep poor people healthy is just a backwards way of looking at the health care economy. I'm a fiscal conservative: this money needs to come from the same source it's funding the welfare state. That means shifting money away from SS and cash transfers (food stamps TANF even W.I.C.). It's going to require a lot of restructuring and the ending of promises that should never have been made (like retiring on the government's time...people need to invest in their own retirements). I would very much prefer health savings accounts but it's hard to do something like that in a way that would actually cover typical health costs without a mandate (which removes the idea that they're voluntary or curated by the individual). Hong Kong does it this way and it's a mandate which can also be accomplished (in a more indirect way) through taxation. ,
Nah payout rates for the uninsured is abysmal for hospitals and ambulances. I work in ambulance billing and it's common for our clients to have 1 in 20 OR LESS uninsured people pay their bill. 1 in 5 uninsured paying for their ambulance ride would be considered really good. This is why we're happy to accept medicaid even though they typically only pay something like 10% of the full rate.Hospitals and ambulances have the most to gain from universal healthcare since payment would become much more reliable. It's going to be Health insurance companies that oppose this because the vast majority of their business would dissolve overnight.,
"Nothing bans private companies from running private insurance or hospitals. Most universal healthcare systems have those. They just a many times redundant and thus a much smaller sector of economy. Also it means said inssurance must provide actual extra value since they cant hold the ""if you don't get coverage you dead"" argument over their customers heads.Usually it is stuff like getting faster to non acute treatmeant (stuff you would like taken care faster but medically you could wait. Thus public sector puts you on lower priority thus might have to wait some time because acute treatment has higher priority to resources) fancier surround (nicer private rooms fancier food etc.) Etc etc.One additional possible private sector thing is employers offering occupational health services from private sector on top of governmental system.",
I'll play:1) Given your other views getting to this is impressive.2) It's as hard to get into this country as it's ever been certainly much tougher than your parents or grandparents faced.3) More hungry kids can't follow you there.  We've already got more than enough.4) Sure whatever.  Americans are armed to the teeth.  The idea that we have any effective gun control is laughable.5) Violent crime is at all time lows pretty much everywhere.  6) Projecting power through foreign aid is much cheaper than projecting it militarily.  There is a ton of fat in the military budget and it should be cut directly.  But of course right wing media will treat this as the end of the world as they always do.Democrats lose because they can't get people to the polls partly because of apathy partly because Republicans are making it hard to vote.  They need to motivate their base I'm not sure this bill will do it but it's at least an attempt.,
I totally *want* to get behind a Universal Healthcare Plan. And I'd be perfectly happy to get behind single payer if the math worked out.But no one has actually put forth a workable plan yet. Even this latest Sanders bill touts amazing lavish benefits but doesn't really describe how we'd pay for it. How can he responsibly offer a bill without a substantive discussion of financing? (I understand that he's taken stabs at a financing plan in the past. But this plan is not coupled with a real discussion of funding.)It's even more upsetting to me that all these Senators aligned behind what is essentially a sham bill. This feels like the sort of irresponsible thing I'd expect from Republicans.My problem isn't so much with Medicare For All as a solution but the fact that we've been hearing the idea bandied about for years and we're still awaiting a responsible financially sound plan.,
Umm this is nothing like that lolBernie is a long term guy - he is doing this now to get people interested so he's already got as many on board as he can once he can actually make the move.  This is how politics works. Things take a lot of time and some ideas don't come to fruition for decades.  But I mean you can tell just by how many democrats have come out in support of single payer healthcare this year that this is getting stronger not weaker. And that means this is likely to be a main platform in the next election and as soon as a democrat gets in office the ball will begin to roll. ,
 >There is NO NEED FOR A TAX INCREASE TO PAY FOR SINGLE PAYER CARE.Indeed.Simply...we spend 2 to 3x more for healthcare than the rest of the Western world because of our catastrophically inefficient system.Go to a doctor in Europe: There's no herd of administrative assistant working for him/her trying to figure out billing. There's *one* person. American patients pay for these eployeesIn all major US cities out of 10 people coming into the ER how many have insurance? 2? 3? Those with insurance pay for those without wether they want it or not.There are many more examples like that.Universal healthcare would tackle a lot of these cost-increasing factors.,
I agree we need serious tax reform. Especially where we spend it of course. That being said I'd love to see some more studies that show how much we pay out of pocket on average to what we would see as a tax increase. In most countries they pay much much less than we do for healthcare services so even with a bit of an income tax hike they end up pay much less at the end of the year.Perhaps this wont be the case with us here in the US but if it is I hope that Bernie makes more of a point to make this clear. That's how it's supposed to work anyways... we'd save money in the end in a perfect world.,
"[Here is Bernie's plan](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all?inline=file)To quote from it> ""In my view there needs to be vigorous debate as to the best way to finance our Medicare for All legislation. Unlike the Republican leadership in Congress which held no hearings on their  disastrous bill which would have thrown 32 million off of health insurance and dealt with onesixth of the American economy it is our intention to get the best ideas we can from economists doctors nurses and ordinary Americans.""He's calling to have an open non-partisan discussion to tackle those very issues. He doesn't have a plan to show people he wants everyone to work together to create one. He has outlined a few examples on how to fund it though to get the ball rolling.",
"I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.   If you want to have healthcare then a better plan would be to purchase some health  insurance coverage. You're actually required to have it.  If you can't afford it the gov't will assist you in purchasing some.   If you don't want to purchase health insurance - my understanding is that President Trump has instructed the IRS to stop going after people for that like they were when Obama was President. Also I don't think Bernie was declaring that Dental Care is a ""fundamental right"" which it isn't.   So as for dental care you probably need to get some dental insurance - Unless you are very poor in which case there are state programs which will assist you in getting basic dental health services.   Good Luck !! ",
"During the campaign his economic advisor was Stephanie Kelton. She's an economist associated with ""Modern Monetary Theory"".  One of the things emphasized by that group  is that the federal government can pay for things without having to first get money through taxation or issuing debt. Most people probably associate that idea with the phrase ""printing money"" and they are concerned that it would cause inflation. Critics are quick to bring up Zimbabwe and the  the Weimar Republic. I'm not persuaded by the comparison without some proof that the increased demand for health care would cause demand inflation but if someone had some evidence that it would I'd consider it. I think the reason Sanders would avoid making these funding arguments is that they're very counter intuitive to people and trying to move towards single payer is already a huge lift without having to also try to persuade people that the monetary system doesn't work like they think it does.",
-No private insurance premiums-Medicaid gone -Chip gone-No ACA Subsidiesthat is going to save money too. So if that is 1/3rd of the outlay for current health insurance programs then that is money we won't be paying in taxes and will shift to paying for Medicare for all. I don't know how much higher it would make our taxes over all but I think it is important to remember there will be elimination of taxes going to these areas. >our health insurance programs ‰ÛÓ Medicare Medicaid the Children‰Ûªs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace subsidies ‰ÛÓ together accounted for 25 percent of the budget in 2015 or $938 billion.  Nearly two-thirds of this amount or $546 billion went to Medicare which provides health coverage to around 55 million people who are over age 65 or have disabilities. The rest of this category funds Medicaid CHIP and ACA subsidy and exchange costs.  **In a typical month Medicaid and CHIP provide health care or long-term care to about 72 million low-income children parents elderly people and people with disabilities.** (Both Medicaid and CHIP require matching payments from the states.)  In 2015 8 million of the 11 million people enrolled in health insurance exchanges received ACA subsidies at an estimated cost of about $28 billion.,
"The ""18-35"" trillion dollar number comes from 10 year projects--the 18 trillion is the estimated cost of Medicare for All over the next 10 years the current trajectory of our current system is 35 trillion. >There is a reason that even California abandoned single payer. It's untenable. Nope. The projected cost to implement it was estimated to be 400 billion if you assume the average cost of medicare recipient in California and times the whole population (which the average Medicare recipient is above average in risks and costs as they're pretty much all eldery--who alone account for most healthcare costs). Actual studies that consider the reduction of inefficiency with the reduction in administrative  cost put it 330 billion in it's total coverage of every citizen in California. Taking account of current public healthcare spending by the State and the amount of burden reduce by existing Federal services and programs that leaves 103 billion in new spending at the more conservative estimate. >and you aren't getting that money from the 1% that's coming straight from the Middle Class and Small Businesses. Actual increase in costs will be minor. The 18 trillion cost by the CBO over the next 10 years is nearly twice as cheaper as would doing nothing and keeping our current system. >because somehow we are more like the thinly populated culturally homogenous Nordic States (we aren't) than we are those to failed states.You're right. We aren't those States. We're better--we're America. Why don't you believe in your country?",
It shows even more Americans how evil and selfish the Republicans are.  The Democrat framing of their ACA repeal brought positive swings in American views of medicare and the ACA (as long as it wasn't tied to that black man).  Now we have Bernie who was pretty darn popular with most of America just not the DNC putting together something that is FOR the 99%.  They know it.All the sexist misogynists who hated Hillary because she was female but not because she was a corporatist war hawk or anything will nod along and murmur that Bernie's ideas certainly sound like a good idea.,
"To show he is serious enough about his policy stance to show it as bill on the record. As in ""This is not some vague concept of universal healthcare I support . When I say I support said policy I mean this policy written out to detail in black and white and on public record.""This means if someone says they are against Bernie can say ""which part"". ""There is a bill about this. If you say you don't like this policy could you please show which statutes of the bill you have issue with."" Cuts wings of drive by critics because they can't just say this policy would mean this or that because what is actually proposed is on record. So opposition can't strawman the policy so easily.Also to make opposite side vote against it to put their stance on record. Plus it is a possibility for supporters put their support on public record.",
Your employer eats most of that insurance cost. In high risk fields about 18% of their budgets go to insurance. That is factored in when hiring new people and helps determine pay rates.If this bill is paid for in a similar fashion to his other Medicare for All proposals your employer's contribution will drop down to a little over 6% freeing up a lot of funds for other use.Unions already have plans to petition for pay raises out of that money because it's already used to account for your personal cost to the company.Otherwise you could see it being used for new equipment  more coworkers or just other benefits. If I can make two assumptions about you: that you have two pay periods per month and you make around $60k a year? In that circumstance even with a wife and two kids you'd pay even less than what you currently do if this new bill has a tax system similar to Bernie's other proposals on the matter. Basically you'd keep that $28 per pay period and your taxes would increase about $20 per pay period net savings of $8 per pay period.,
"> I'm not paying thousands of dollars per year to go into a medical cost pool when I never even go to the doctor.What's next?

And Medicare uses a well known feature of the market to its advantage the monopoly. We don't allow them to exist usually because their economies of scale allow them to be far too efficient cost-wise for competitors to keep up. This is exactly what we need for medicine to make it cheaper and widely available. Also less red tape you just go in see your doctor and that's it. No paper work. No claims. No one there to process forms and deny claims (well not as many). It's extremely simplified process. Doctors also just then need to sum up their bills at the end of the month or what ever and just bill Medicare no need to chase up unpaid bills or deal with different insurance agencies. ,
"Yeah the problem is that the system has been moving in a badly-constructed ""private health insurance"" manner for almost a century now. It was perfectly decent 100 years ago (it was actually a private system with the government having little involvement) but the doctors complained they weren't getting paid enough (there was too much competition and licensing wasn't a big deal so supply of doctors was much looser than today). So they effectively formed a profession union via the AMA which has strangled the system ever since then with increasing regulations licensing requirements and educational strictures. That's all fine...if you want a system that just keeps getting more and more expensive.As a classic liberal health care has deeply troubled me: I do not want socialized medicine (it's just not economical) but private insurance has almost completely failed at this point. We need a system that keeps costs down and holds people accountable for their health care services. It's simply a mess right now...I'm very cautiously optimistic that some kind of sea-change can improve it in a better direction. Still my biggest concern is obvious: we will continue to struggle with keeping costs down and will have to resort to longer waiting times and denial of service to ""more costly""  (i.e. very elderly) treatment options. It's a very mixed bag any way you slice it. ",
Bernie himself has said this doesn't have a chance of passing right now with this Congress but politics isn't a zero sum game.Republicans voted more than 60 times to repeal and replace Obamacare while Obama was still in office. They knew they wouldn't get their wish but by actively campaigning and voting for it (over and over again) they convinced the American public (Republicans anyway) that it was an important issue that needed to be a focus of future elections.Medicare-For-All is an important issue that needs to be a focus of American politics.16 Senators and 117 House Representatives supporting Medicare For All is a hell of a start. We're going to push for much more support across the board from our currently elected representatives and from the candidates who challenge them in future elections.,
2018 is super optimistic.  Like we'll need the ACA to get rejected before the end of this year and people will unfortunately need to be dying in the streets outside of insurance companies and hospitals with letters denying claims in order for people to get mobilized enough to maybe force politicians to change their attitude by the END of 2018 at best.No I think this is still a 2025-ish thing and we'll have some slightly worse misery than now until then.  2020 will be interesting since The Donald and Republicans in Congress getting reelected would likely slow it even further,
"I remember all that and I remember the constant demonization of Hillary throughout the 90s and I remember the accusations of ""socialism"" and ""communism"" and ""liberalism"" during the Bush years and post 9-11.  And I remember the episode of The Ellen Show where she first came out of the closet only to be quickly cancelled by ABC and called obscene by the prominent conservatives of the time.  Things change sometimes very quickly.  The best way to affect that change is to truly believe it is possible.  Pessimism is practical for our own emotional stability but not in pushing forward changes that a society needs.  I'm in Group 3 but I'll gladly stand with Group 1 on this. ",
">People only glommed onto ""Medicare for all"" because they think it'll make it easier to ""sell"" SPH to ""the dumb rubes"" but that is not the way politics worksThat's an incredibly cynical way to look at efforts to make the philosophical underpinnings of a political debate more accessible to broad American audiences. Sanders et al are pushing for a radical change to the U.S. healthcare system. You're right that it's clearly a tough fight but naturally in any fight you'll end up doing better with momentum; the 'Medicare for All' slogan immediately forms a bridge for the most people possible between a hypothetical future and a current political reality certainly cutting through barriers of educational attainment and English language status better than 'Single Payer Healthcare'.Drawing people into the topic is the first major step towards a reflection on the underlying ideas of a piece of legislation and the real-life context in which it would unfold. That **is** how politics works.",
Thank you. I am 100% in favor of a single payer system. But my wants and dreams don't create reality. Hard policy work does. And sorry Bernie is not a policy wonk. He's a speech guy. That isn't a slam. We need speech guys to sell the policies wonks design.I hope all this is right now is a rhetorical salvo off the GOP's bow. Democrats are taking stock of how malleable the center is to this idea.Then whenever we get back Congress and the WH we can set out and do the real work of designing a way to transfer 1/6 of the U.S. economy from private hands to public hands. And that work will be hard messy painful annoying long and filled with compromises.If that turns you off please make another issue _your_ issue. ,
"Here's one thing that whatever health-care bill we pass needs to be: Opt-in. Think about the single most effective attack on Obamacare. What was it? Not the higher premiums not the mandate - those were effective but not what people rallied around. The big Obamacare lie was ""if you like your plan you can keep it."" People don't like change and having the government come in and change something you're used to produces backlash.This is why a public-option opt-in system would be a significantly better and more strategically sound tack. This means that the only people making the switch (at first) would be those willing to and slowly it would drive costs down and become more socially accepted by the public. We can expand it from there.",
I'm over 50.  The way I think about this is that this is a long haul project.  This shouldn't dissuade people.  The demographics are with us in the long term.  Furthermore if the GOP has shown us anything is that you can set goals ignore the naysayers and keep on pushing and it is likely to happen (even if the things they've pushed for are just fucking awful).  I say this  because I think Dems unlike the GOP tend to give up on currently unpopular ideas quickly rather than pushing them.  To be fair though the GOP's base is easy to manipulate and conservative media has a much better hold on them then liberal media as on its base.Still if we hunker down for the long hall and push the demographics will get us there though it may take a generation to do so.,
I'm older than 35 so that's why I probably understand this more than the 90% of redditors who keep arguing 'single payer single payer single payer'. The plan that Bernie put out in the primaries was a complete joke. It provided little or no cost savings measures and it just basically shifted the full cost from the individual to the government WHILE also giving people more healthcare services and coverage. It was a joke. 'Single payer' healthcare used by the developed world (many are in fact mutli-player but lets go with it for now) has a lot of cost cutting measures. They limit who you can see when you can see it how long you have to wait etc. You're analogy to Frank Luntz and the 'death tax' is spot on. 'Single payer' is the left's 'death tax'.  Just saying 'single payer' is what allowed Bernie to push out a plan that proposed to save Americans more in prescription drugs than they actually spend right now....because with those magic words of 'single payer' you can say anything else and certain people will buy it. ,
Things change. You're looking at politics as static when in fact the opposite is true. Trump was elected because he had a populist campaign. The Republicans just elected a populist. Actually they knowingly elected a con-artist who was pretending to be a populist. This should tell you just how much politics have shifted.People are fed up with not having enough money to pay for health care. And the Republicans just destroyed all their credibility when it comes to health care.The stage has been set for a populist overhaul of the healthcare system. It's absolutely possible. Is it likely? Nothing in politics is likely. Our system is designed to resist change from any direction. But if you don't try then you turn a 30 percent chance into a zero percent chance.,
"I don't think any mature adult thinks that this will be an easy thing to do. I think your post makes a big assumption that the people for it do not understand the nuances of the issue. It is of course vastly complicated and upends quite a bit of the system we currently have. But we also need to face the reality that a lot of Americans do. We have a health care system that is too expensive for most people to take advantage of. I pay a little over $3600 a year for a $3000 deductible. It means that unless I am in dire need I avoid going to the doctor. And I know for a fact that I am better off than a lot of other people. What does that say about our system? The fact remains that we have a system that is no longer working and enough of the country is demanding a change.I know the point you are trying to make; it is absolutely difficult. But difficult does not equate to ""don't try"". We can't afford to not try. I don't think it is fair to equate a rough draft of an alternative plan intended for voters to get a general idea of it to an entire policy proposal. No voter is going to sit down and read thousands of pages of legalese to see how the plan will in effect roll out. It's a bit dishonest of you to try to pass that off as proof of it being something that cannot work in spirit. Obama did not come to the party with the thousands of pages that the ACA ended up being. You start with an idea and you tweak it to get as close to that ideal as you possibly can. If you as insinuating that Bernie should have come with that much data then you are not remembering Ross Perot's infomercials and how effective those were... Nothing and I mean nothing about our system makes any sense whatsoever. It is totally asinine and the ACA was simply a bandaid. I'm 35. I remember the 90's and that is ancient history. The playing field is different. The issues facing Americans are different. If the attitude we are going to take is ""that's too hard and complicated so lets not try"" then why do anything at all? In fact why should any ever vote for a Democrat if that is what they will offer? ""I'm not a Republican"" is demonstrably not good enough because that is not bringing people to the polls. ",
"Remember? I live with it every day.How many people here actually have an elderly parent on Medicare or a spouse on Medicaid? Look up the ""Donut Hole"". Try to find a doctor that will take on additional Medicare/Medicaid patients. Try to find a corner clinic that takes Medicare/Medicaid (sorry you're only choice is wait for your doctor tomorrow/monday or go to the emergency room). Hope you have supplemental insurance in case Medicare/Medicaid doesn't cover  some of your prescriptions.True you may not have to  ""pay"" for care but that doesn't mean you'll get (timely) care either. There will be rationing.I used to get major medical health insurance for about $35/month. If I got sick I went to the doctor and paid him. If I needed antibiotics I paid the pharmacy. If I had a really bad year or got something major (cancer heart attack) THEN it kicked in. Because insurance is supposed to cover large unexpected costs not every single everyday cost. That's not insurance that's a warranty. And you couldn't afford car ""insurance"" if it was legislated to be delivered the same way as health insurance is now.And people actually PAY into Medicare for decades via FICA before they can see any of the benefits.But I do agree that health care is a ""right"". Just like freedom of speech is a right. Bearing arms is a right. But that doesn't mean the government gives you a radio station or an AR-15 for free. You have the right to seek treatment without undue restrictions by the government. That's what a right truly is. And that's why both parties are screwed up when the describe health care as a (or not a) ""Right"".",
Because Bernie sanders has been building on this idea for decades I've been fighting for it for 17 years and there has never been this much support behind it.  I am making an assumption when I say it will definitely happen but that's because it's trending in that way.  If you look at other movements throughout history you'll notice that they started as a small idea then became a crazy idea then became a plausible idea then became a viral idea and then became reality. SlaveryWomen's right to vote Marijuana legislationGay marriage Among other things...what I notice when I look through history is that the progressives always ultimately win they just take a lot longer getting there.  But it's a steady uphill battle with small obstacles along the way.  Look at it over decades rather than months or even years. See Trump has his small wins here and there for his beliefs and his party but in the end we all know the next president will work diligently to undo everything he has done and we will ultimately get back to the progressive agenda.  The progressive agenda tends to be a constant underneath everything we see happening from day to day. It's slowly building momentum in the background while the show happens in the present.  Don't be too distracted by the show to acknowledge the whole picture. This is all just my thoughts.  You're welcome to disagree. ,
This is the most techbro answer to a question that is not about tech. Doctors and the cost of training Doctors is not the main cost of health care in the US. For profit pharmaceutical companies and hospitals inflating insurance costs are amongst the biggest reasons for health inflation in the US. >Investing 1/1000 of what it would take to have universal healthcare into AI research and it would be much more effective.This is a ridiculous claim without any backing evidence for it. Yes there are technological policies which could help cut some costs- telemedicine for example. But the thing is we have evidence from across the world that universal healthcare is more efficient and cost effective than for profit healthcare so why would you throw that money into AI research when we know that the move to universal healthcare would be so much effective at providing healthcare for all?,
Although he may have lost the primary Bernie Sanders earned himself some serious political capital within the Democratic party. If you had told even the people who liked and supported him that he would be packing 20K seat arenas and come as close as he did to winning the primary they'd have laughed at you. I have loved Bernie for YEARS and although I was happy to see him announce his candidacy I never thought at the start that he actually had a shot. He shook the party to its core in last year. Not only did he nearly win while running openly as a Democratic Socialist he seized complete control of the American youth voters. The Democratic Party always has and always will need the youth vote that Bernie was winning the 18-30 crowd by 60 70 and 80% and pulling record primary turnouts in that age group meant they HAD to give him a prominant voice. Even if they were (and are) kicking and screaming the whole way. ,
Because it's not fully formed and it's not fully formed because it would require a tax increase. People don't want to be on record supporting a tax increase unless they can actually pass the increase and they do not have anywhere near the power to do that.This is leaving out that it would be very destructive to a large industry that employs thousands of people representing hundreds of billions in stock value or to phrase it differently it would crash part of the economy.It's something that needs to happen but doing as a partnership between public and private like most of Europe does would be far less disruptive.,
"Sanders has the backing of Senators from mostly firmly Democratic states. These are the folks that would only lose their seats to people even further Left than they are. The other Dems who are not yet supporting the bill are the ones who actually have to fight off strong Republican challenges and can't risk alienating the centrists and moderates by supporting a very far Left wing bill in its infancy. Right now the name of the game is winning elections in 2018 not passing legislation. Especially since if Bernie by some miracle puts this bill on Trump's desk and gets Trump to sign it into law Republicans will blast it as a massive right wing victory from now until the 2020 election. ""Trump promised to fix Obamacare and look at how much money you're saving now!""The average voter isn't smart enough to know who did what. All they'll know is that Trump is President and they have more money.",
It comes down to lobbyists. Many congressmen are given money to campaign each year by insurance lobbyists and pharmaceutical lobbyists who will stop giving them money or worse give money to their adversaries in their district. Others are in districts who have opponents who are already given campaign money by these lobbyists who will be given even more money and support if they work against their best interests. Since universal healthcare would (likely) mean (much needed) regulation on the pharmaceutical industry and a massive cut for the health insurance industry they risk losing money.If the lobbyists refuse to do their job they are fired. If the corporations who hire these lobbyists refuse to give these orders they will lose profit. And if publically traded companies don't act in the best (monetary) interests of their shareholders? The shareholders will undoubtedly vote in a CEO/board who will (and can even sue those not working in the best interests of their investments).The politicians are stuck because they are afraid their opponents will be even worse for the country than they are. They might not have control over these issues but they still have some power. The CEOs are beholden to shareholders who are largely stock brokers who are legally bound to get the most money possible for their clients who rarely (if ever) look into or even know what stocks are in their portfolios. There are some independant stock owners who actually...take stock...in their companies but they are vastly outnumbered by big bank combined funds.,
The first thing you have to understand about American politics is that the American electorate is shortsighted and stupid.  We would not have such awful politicians if we didn't have such an awful citizenry.  Unions are in tatters and often demonized so collective bargaining isn't in the zeitgeist at all.  People here are convinced there's no way for them to get more money from their employer and they shouldn't even try that the only way they can make more money is if they pay less taxes.Universal healthcare would by necessity involve the largest tax increase in US history.  That tax increase *should* be made up for by employers giving their employees the money that they currently spend on employee healthcare but US employees have no ability to conceive of their employers paying them more money so they have no ability to demand it.  This means that from their perspective a tax increase *that should save them money* is instead the evil Democrats taking their money away.  Even a lot of otherwise hardcore liberal voters in deep blue states believe this.Nobody has found a successful means of getting through to the people of this country that they deserve more money from their employers and have the ability to get it and that taxes are by and large good for them rather than bad.  You would need a blue supermajority Congress who were willing to torpedo their political careers in order to both pass universal healthcare and strongarm employers into giving that saved money to their employees because the employees aren't going to take it of their own volition.,
> What the hell is wrong with the other two thirds...I think they will come around but the first group to stick their necks out are confident that voters from their home states are supportive.  If that sounds daft it is.  In the US we have a problem where right wing media have been telling lies to the people for decades about this issue.  I won't rehash all of it here but instead of looking at the many functioning models of public health care in the world a sizeable number of right leaning Americans have been convinced that we have some sort of free market exceptional model at work that needs preserving.  It is mind boggling really.,
This is what I do not get about the USA. Other than roads and police services the tangible benefit of your taxes is often not seen by the common person.I'm not sure how people don't riot in the state's come tax season.  EDIT: Ok too many to reply to. I lived in America for a number of years though I am Canadian and moved back to Canada.That being said generally I see a lot of my taxes go towards all the things I care about. I have healthcare the social security and such programs work real well. The materity/paternity pay is great. The disability care is pretty good. Our education system is great as is our day care subsidies are good. Can it be better sure?In the USA in the state's I lived I've even had to pay an extra fee for having the fire department even have a chance to respond. Local community centers were massively underfunded. The amount of toll roads was insane.  The prisons are often for profit. The cost of community collages was far higher than Canada. The DMV run by the state was inefficient and often under staffed. Even the police were understaffed it felt like.It was my impression that all the taxes I paid went to nothing. That was just a feeling I got.In Canada at least I have the piece of mind that when a medical emergency comes up I can focus on my family and not my finances and paperwork. If nothing else that tangible benefit puts my mind at ease that my taxes are doing something.,
Either:a) don‰Ûªt have health insurance so if something like Medicare For All became law you would now have health insurance and only pay an additional 1% on all income over $29000/year ‰ÛÓ in your case that‰Ûªs just $210 in additional taxes per **year**. Not to mention everyone else would also now have access to healthcare which is a very charitable endeavor.or b) you do have health insurance and would now pay considerably less than you did before ‰ÛÓ in your case you would pay around $200 less than you did before assuming you had insurance through your employer. You would also be protected from losing your health insurance in the event you leave an employer with insurance as a benefit. This is a big deal for families who rely on a single family members employment status for their heath and wellbeing. Such a plan would a great thing for the economy over time.source: [Options to Finance Medicare For All](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all)Also if you really are paying $40-50k/year in taxes you‰Ûªre doing something seriously wrong. Not to mention you‰Ûªre already paying for Medicare/Medicaid both of which would go away with something like Medicare For All.,
Uh...health care? Once the middle-man is removed we can have more people working administrative jobs directly in the health care system instead of all these middle-man positions (which is what private insurance has essentially become unwittingly or not). Here's a crazy idea: how about having more nurses with fewer hours? Why nurses have to work 10-14 hours at a time is insane to me: let's take all those lame paper-shuffling desk jobs and turn them into health care workers. Of course people have to make their own choices but that seems like a far more fulfilling position than approving insurance claims (and it probably pay more even with fewer hours). ,
"That kind of proves my point though. Americans don't like the words ""Single payer"" and the images of communism that comes with them. From that very study you linked 60% of Americans feel the federal gov't is responsible for ensuring healthcare coverage. If you went up to folks and said ""Hey do you support healthcare coverage that you pay less for is already working for retired folks over the age of 65 and would get rid of things like deductibles coverage gaps and other insurance company fuckeries"" you'd likely get a big ""Hell yes sign me up!"" in response.  If you go up to people and say ""Do you support a government single payer program for healthcare?"" you're gonna get back a ""that sounds like red commie stuff no way!"" from a good portion of respondents. I realize it's just a silly play on words but it makes a difference. Look at the Jimmy Kimmel ""[Obamacare vs. Affordable Care Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx2scvIFGjE)"" videos to see exactly this phenomenon in action.",
"It's bad economics (the wealthy did nothing to deserve higher taxes except get good at building wealth which oftentimes gets reinvested into the economy: good for everyone) but I understand that sentiment: it's good old fashion socialism. We could do this is a much more ""American"" (i.e. privately-managed) way but we've already been going down the ""universal"" route for so long (and have so many bureaucracies that manage health care for vast segments of society except people between 18-65 for the most part) that it seems inevitable at this point. I'm not thrilled (as a fiscal conservative) but Republicans have presented few other decent options. ",
"Well ""single-payer"" and ""medicare for all"" might end up being surprisingly flexible terms if it makes political and practical sense for them to be it wouldn't be the craziest rhetorical trick American politics has pulled off in living memoryI think the making a case for a better plan/hashing out the details of how we make this work is what happens through the legislating process. Right now imho we need to make the case to lawmakers about *what* we want in a general sense once a bill has been introduced and is getting reviewed in committees and such we can drill in on *how* we get there exactly.",
"Why do you support a commie? Here's what Trump published back in 2000 on Universal healthcare in his book ""America We Deserve"":>Today many Americans can't even get in their doctors' doors for the medical attention they need... HMOs and PPOs aren't working. Prescription medicine is hard to come by at a reasonable price. Medicare is suffering from immense financing problems.This breakdown in doctor-patient relations is caused by the growth of a new bureaucracy--the health insurance delivery system. American healthcare has a couple of toes in the grave despite the fact that our medical science is the most advanced on earth... And yet top-of-the-line American medical science is out of reach of most Americans.>The healthcare bureaucrats are depriving Americans of care in order to keep costs down. Medical care is so expensive in fact that millions of Americans have no health insurance at all.Here's the real scandal: According to James Frogue in a Heritage Foundation memorandum around ten million American children have no insurance coverage. This isn't to say they can't get medical attention--though some activists would have us think so--but they are often treated in hospital emergency rooms which is the most expensive type of care. Routine medical care for these kids often doesn't exist.>The structure of the healthcare industry is confusing and expensive at every level and there's no simple solution. Since the Truman administration our country has been trying to implement a system that protects all citizens.>I'm a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one. We should not hear so many stories of families ruined by healthcare expenses. We must not allow citizens with medical problems to go untreated because of financial problems or red tape. It is an unacceptable but accurate fact that the number of uninsured Americans has risen to forty-two million.Working out detailed plans will take time. But the goal should be clear: Our people are our greatest asset. We must take care of our own. We must have universal healthcare.>Just imagine the improved quality of life for our society as a whole if the issue of access to healthcare were dealt with imaginatively. With more than forty million Americans living day to day in the fear that an illness or injury will wipe out their savings or drag them into bankruptcy how can we truly engage in the ""pursuit of happiness"" as our Founders intended?UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE>What would universal care look like?>Nebraska senator Kerrey and others have advocated a version of the Canadian-style single-payer syste in which all payments for medical care made to a single agency (a opposed to the large number of HMOs and insurance companies with their diverse rules claim forms and deductibles). A recent study done by the Massachusetts Medical Society says that in Massachusetts the single-payer plan would save $5 billion or about one-seventh of the overhead spent on the medical care. Administrative costs across America make up 25 percent of the healthcare dollar which is two-and-a-half times the cost of healthcare administration in Canada. Doctors might be paid less than they are now as is the case in Canada but they would be bale to treat more patients because of the reduction in their paperwork.The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than Americans. There are fewer medical lawsuits less loss of labor to sickness and lower costs to companies paying for the medical care of their employees. If the program were in place in Massachusetts in 1999 it would have reduced administrative costs by $2.5 million.We need as a nation to reexamine the single-payer plan as many individual states are doing.",
"[FWIW](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/350298-schumer-noncommittal-on-sanderss-medicare-for-all-bill)>""Democrats believe that health care is a right for all and there are many different bills out there. There are many good ones"" Schumer told reporters during a weekly leadership press conference.>...>Schumer noted that in addition to Sanders Democratic Sens. Brian Schatz (Hawaii) and Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) have offered health care bills.>""We want to move the issue forward. We're looking at all of these"" he said.So DINOsaur might be a bit harsh imo. I definitely support the notion of calling him up and letting him know what you'd like to see out of the American healthcare system tho.",
4 decades? Our modern economy is built on capitalism...it's not propaganda buddy. The only argument for socialized medicine that even passes the smell test (because socialism is bullshit: using other American's wealth without their consent is legalized theft plain and simple) is the fact that we have vast amounts of wealth in this country that are poorly allocated (by the government...not private individuals who should rightly pursue their own self interests). That fact is this will be a major burden on our economy but health care already was. We're caught between a rock and a hard place make no mistake about that. ,
">How much will it save the private sector?You will be paying about 2.4% (give or take a few .%'s) increased taxes. On average that's about 500 to 1500 a year for most Americans.Now subtract what you're currently paying for healthcare. You're *already* saving money.Now imagine not paying copays out-of-pocket fees over-budget fees over-lifetime fees and no prescription fees. Now you're saving a whole lot more and you don't have to carry around health insurance cards or deal with shitty insurance companies.The effort alone is worth it. Insurance companies will be forced to adapt and CEO's will be forced to live with a few million $ less each month.>What about long term savings from having near universal coverage?Not ""near"" ""full"". This will cover literally everyone.>Is this enough to eventually bring our per capita spending to a level comparable to other first world nations?No because our system has a lot of stuff that needs to be taken care of but after renegotiation and other programs one day it might. It won't happen within the next presidential term but it may eventually happen (pending another Trump-esque president in the future).The per capita spending will inherently go down though.",
>1) Given your other views getting to this is impressive.I'm not convinced universal healthcare is a good idea. But I think it's almost inevitable. Even Republicans are starting to support it.>2) It's as hard to get into this country as it's ever been certainly much tougher than your parents or grandparents faced.Legally? Yes. Illegally? Seems pretty easy.>3) More hungry kids can't follow you there. We've already got more than enough.No I agree. We've got to feed the kids once they exist. I'm just saying that it would be good to try to figure out some way of preventing people from having those kids in the first place. How? I don't know. But there are probably ways of tying welfare to lack of reproducing which would help.>4) Sure whatever. Americans are armed to the teeth. The idea that we have any effective gun control is laughable.But is that more because we don't have enough laws or because we don't have enough enforcement? In any case gun crime is mostly not committed by Republicans. I can understand them being miffed at being penalized for other people's criminality.>5) Violent crime is at all time lows pretty much everywhere.Yes but Democrats aren't gonna win many votes outside their existing base by standing up for violent criminals. They're also not helping the communities most affected by violent crime which are poor minority communities through these stances. They're just helping the criminal element in those communities.>6) Projecting power through foreign aid is much cheaper than projecting it militarily. There is a ton of fat in the military budget and it should be cut directly. But of course right wing media will treat this as the end of the world as they always do.I'd cut it if I could. But we agree on this matter - unfortunately it's a tough sell. It's not just the right-wingers who oppose such things. Obama wasn't exactly Mr. Peacenik. The Dems are not exactly an isolationist party.,
Most Americans support something when they hear nothing but the flowers and rainbows and don't hear the potential negatives. We negotiate costs way down so hospitals and doctors go out of business. Hell there are plenty of hospitals going under NOW. Then you get the massive increase in demand and less access to the service. Average wait time in Canada is 17 weeks. Four months. Their specialist care isn't as good as ours. We don't even have a solid handle on what it would cost people. I don't know how much it would cost me and if it would be a net increase for me or not.  People haven't been faced with that. When they do you should prepare to see support go down. ,
That's flat out false. It costs too much plain and simple. It will never work. What works for other countries won't always work for us. Only way to make it work is taxes going through the roof. We have 20 trillion dollars in debt so instead of making irrational policies and deciding where money that isn't ours should go we should instead focus on money we do HAVE not money we don't posess. There's people who've argued our debt is a massive threat to our national security. There is no money for this unless of course we just put it on the tax payers tab instead of legislators or senators pay for it themselves which will never happen. ,
I don't care what the rest of those countries are doing. I don't live in those countries. I live in what is called The United States of America. Not Canada. Not Britain. Not Germany. Not France. Not Italy. Not any other country in the world. I live in The United States of America. This country is different than every single other country in the world. Our budgetary needs are different than every single other country in the world. I would like to see it work in a few states here in the United States of America before we implement an untested system across the entire United States of America which could have catastrophic budgetary effects.

A lot of people believe that our tax system/annual budget can be reorganized to take in the same amount or slightly less with a single payer bill as part of the equation. Thus not increasing the tax burden on anyone and still offering single payer otherwise it's a perception that the government is just increasing its bloat. It's not that it is not logical its more that if they are going to pass something like this they need to be responsible about it instead of just increasing the burden on the tax payers. $1200 a month is a lot and reducing that to 600 is important but most people do not view paying the government as the same thing as paying a private company for insurance. They also do not think the government can truly handle the burden of operating such a monolithic system and their tax dollars will go to waste instead of actually to the care system they are paying for. ,
"Honestly I don't even think it's the messenger that matters here. It's one of the reasons I never was that upset hillary didn't back single payer... because it's more about time. It's just gonna take time for the core goodness of the idea to filter through the population - like gay marriage. There was no one person who led the fight to legalizing gay marriage it was just this slow tide of more and more people realizing the undenialble truth of ""oh wait there's nothing wrong with gay people getting married"" and the same will happen here... more and more people will just realize ""oh wait ensuring everyone has healthcare is a good idea""",

While I'm in school still continuing my education the person who is already in the workforce has had numerous pay increases and promotions and is likely to be making just as much or even more than a physician. The wealthy are the minority who decide to go into private practice. Your not seeing that type of money working in a clinic or hospital. Again the path to medicine is long and rigorous. Every MD I know loves what they do salary the payoff for all the hard work.,

"That won't happen.  We have broader coverage requirements without the same cutoffs.  In the US doctors are not allowed to overrule patient and family wishes in the context of medical futility.  Your 82 year old demented grandma is in renal failure because she can't remember to eat?  In the US we'd place a port and start hemodialysis (if the family desires).  In the U.K./France/Germany?  Hospice no matter what the family wants.  Look at the recent situation in UK with  Charlie Gard:  his parents wanted to keep him alive despite medical futility (i.e. Tracheostomy PEG tube and life on a ventilator). The courts said no and forced a withdrawal of care on a child despite the parents wishes.   That will never happen here (Americans can't be told no when it comes to healthcare; their unalienable ""right"" to it and all).  If universal healthcare in the form of unlimited Medicaid for all happens it will bankrupt this country. ",
That exactly the kind of thinking that killed millions in Russia. The farmers were great at producing food so naturally they became rich. The useless leeches of society felt this was unfair so they killed the successful farmers and took their land. Since they were useless they produced no food and millions starved. Those who didn't starve went hungry and suffered from malnutrition everyday waiting in bread lines. You have to remember a rich person got rich by giving something to the masses that they wanted. You kill all the givers and next thing you know there'll be nothing for you to take.If you don't learn from history you're bound to repeat it and most likely starve thanks to your own ignorance. Just say no kiddo.,
"Right. Except single-payor overlooks the most important factor and it's PRICING. There is very little stake in responsibility when the claims just get paid by the government. In which case you don't have behemoths like Cigna and BlueCross reviewing claims before paying them. So you might propose a fee schedule. Sure. Have you ever tried negotiating a surgery?  You cannot just call up a doctor and say ""You're getting paid this much"" and expect them to take it. I was a huge Bernie supporter and single-payor supporter but after having worked almost two years now doing claims integrity it makes me wince thinking how much fraud and abuse would increase if we instated single-payor. Moreover it won't happen because Cigna BlueCross Humana etc. won't let it happen. They own all the influence and have more money than God to throw at whatever they want. What we need is PRICING and INTEGRITY way before ever thinking of even trying single-payor. ALSO the reason you stop paying into SS at a certain point is to force people to diversify investments so that their entire retirement isn't sitting with the government. It's a very logical process. And that money goes back to the person who pays into it not public funds. ",
"Looking at the tax increase other countries pay (as it contributes to healthcare) I would happily take this over paying premiums.  There's so many reasons why.1) Most importantly it allows people to have freedom of where they work.  Unless you are really well off you know someone who works a job they hate because it has benefits they need/want.  If you no longer MUST be employed to get healthcare it's a huge swing in power.  England I believe (please correct me if I have misresearched this next statement) you can have healthcare offered by your employer that is on top of the care.  This coverage allows you more coverage or ""skip places in line"" that kind of stuff.  2) Lower cost for providers.  Having to figure out the ICD-9 code that BCBS will take over UHC requires encyclopedic knowledge of the working of the system.   Instead the doctor can simply bill one code and the provider will accept it.3) Lower cost to the average user.  Yes you will have higher taxes.  But you are no longer paying that large monthly premium.  I pay thousands a year in premiums for my family.   Taxed based on research of what other countries pay is lower than that.  Heck even if it was the exact same point 1 still holds. ",
"I wonder how different it will be from his campaign plan. Keep in mind this is part of a more comprehensive tax plan rather than just a healthcare bill:>""We will raise taxes‰Ûù the Vermont Senator told a crowd at the CNN Democratic town hall this week. ""Yes we will.""Sanders who is neck-and-neck with Hillary Clinton in Iowa and leading New Hampshire has proposed an array of ambitious new government programs from free college tuition and paid family leave to universal health care and recently dropped a new tax plan explaining how he'd pay for it all.>""It's a very very very big tax increase for everyone except those at the bottom"" Roberton Williams a fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told TIME.>In an analysis released today the Tax Foundation an independent tax policy research organization found that Sanders' plan would lead to 10.56% lower after-tax income for all taxpayers and a 17.91% lower after-tax income for the wealthiest Americans. When accounting for reduced GDP taxpayers would see their after-tax incomes fall by 12.84% on average the report said.Williams was more cautionary. ""There are also a lot of moving pieces"" he explained. ""It's a big tax increase but there are all these goodies on the other end. So there will be winners and losers."">Take for example Sanders' plan to provide universal single-payer healthcare. Sanders says he'd pay for that with a new 2.2% income-based ""health care premium"" tax as well as a 6.2% payroll tax paid for by employers. That adds up to a big increase‰ÛÓbut it also means that in exchange Americans would save the thousands of dollars they spend every year on premiums deductibles and other out-of-pocket health care costs.>The typical American family of four covered by an employer-sponsored health care plan paid $24671 last year on health care costs alone according to the non-partisan Milliman Medical Index.""The savings that Americans would gain by the elimination of private insurance premiums and deductibles are much greater than the public insurance premiums they would pay under Bernie‰Ûªs plan"" Warren Gunnels Sanders' policy director told TIME.http://time.com/4194179/bernie-sanders-tax-plan/",
This must also be accompanied by the reduction of healthcare provisions in other forms of insurance.  The costs of Property and auto insurance should reduce since the personal injury is no longer part of it.It would be a larger reach but the amount my employer says they pays for my healthcare should also be in consideration.  Since Medicare is infinitely lower cost a percentage should be moved into that tax and the balance should be added to my paycheck.The average uneducated viewer sees higher taxes but does not understand this should be a net gain to the average American.,
The startup I was working for sold to a huge corporation.  My monthly insurance costs dropped by about 80% from our shitty small company group plan we had been on.  When I compare employer contribution plus what I was paying vs now the big company has a much better deal.  Their group plan spreads the risk across tens of thousands and ours was tens of participants.  It is quite frustrating.  I have the same health now as I did then my use of health care services is the same. I'm doing the same work.  Yet I'm paying  different prices and access to the system because of my employer.  ,
Part of the problem is that they don't make those problems to themselves which kind of betrays their own supposed principles. If and when conservatives are in favor of something that I see will help my principles I will accept that as a good point for that thing and actively acknowledge it. I acknowledge that there seems to be better evidence that market based systems are very useful in providing certain things more efficiently. My sympathies lie entirely with communists people who want things to be selected more democratically. But I am willing to work in the apparent usefulness of market systems into my ideology because my ultimate ideology is to maximise the average utility of the whole social order and in doing so help maximise my own utility. But conservatives only adhere to social utility when convenient asserting a quaint fantasy that will achieve it which just so happens to take the form of corporatocracy when enacted. And that fantasy can be shown for the smokescreen that it is when liberals put forward something to actually appease it and they reject it. If conservatives actually believed in entrepreneurship they would enact universal healthcare to help entrepreneurs. The reason they don't is because they don't. They only care about appeasing the already powerful.,
"The savings will be statistical. Most will be better off. Some will be much better off. A few will be worse off. The problem is the republicans are the party of the anecdote. They will find some person that is paying more and that will be the next ""Joe the plumber"" figure that gets trotted out as an example of the government screwing people. The savings are also hidden in taxes. So your tax bill is higher but your not paying insurance premium directly. Also your tax bill is higher for your whole life while your insurance premiums start low and get higher with age. Many people will see higher taxes and not understand that on average over your life this is much cheaper than the old way. It's a hard sell and the difficulty is compounded by the fact that one party has no intention of making this a fact based intelligent discussion. ",
> on average the total premiums paid between you and your employer is $17K or more for a family plan.I hope people are not so naive as to think everyone that has health insurance through work now will get a raise equal to what their employer was formerly paying towards their insurance.  More like you and your employer paid a total of $17k now the employer gets $8500/employee extra and the health insurance tax of $13k means you get to make up the difference over and above your $8500 you are paying in health insurance tax rather than to Blue Cross or whoever any more so there's an extra $375 a month gone from your check. ,
>Republicans voted more than 60 times to repeal and replace Obamacare while Obama was still in office. They knew they wouldn't get their wish but by actively campaigning and voting for it (over and over again) they convinced the American public (Republicans anyway) that it was an important issue that needed to be a focus of future elections.I really wish Clinton and her supporters understood this is how incrimentalism actually works.  It's what the GOPs been doing for decades and they've incrimented us to a racist Nazi sympathizing POTUS.  You keep pushing the window while locking in your gains via compromise not negotiate with yourself before you even sit at the table.  Her methods let the GOP keep pushing us right. ,
> Republicans voted more than 60 times to repeal and replace Obamacare while Obama was still in office. They knew they wouldn't get their wish but by actively campaigning and voting for it (over and over again) they convinced the American public (Republicans anyway) that it was an important issue that needed to be a focus of future elections.And now they can't repeal or replace the ACA because they never developed a workable plan beyond campaign slogans.  Democrats should be wary of falling into the same trap.  This is a great start but they need to refine the policy and the messaging.  Far too many people seem to believe that single payer is inevitable because it's the best policy and it's popular. But there is no real workable policy yet and it will be extremely difficult to maintain public support once the attacks begin.,
It'd be interesting to propose as an opt-in - you can jump into it if you want and be taxed accordingly or stick to private plans.  Let the market decide which is better.  Even if it cost me a little more I would join to support the cause and simplify the miserable billing process and coverage anxiety.  I don't think Medicare could be reliably ramped up to the entire population in one year anyway.Then there's the old burn and pillage form of rolling it out - government seizes the health insurance industry and trims out the bullshit.  Use the former insurance employees as new government employees and get rid of the overpaid execs that think they can do better elsewhere.,
"How is it unrealistic to extend medicare to everyone?You learned the wrong lesson from 2016. The lesson is that people are tired of neoliberal policies which tell the working class that they have to be crushed by pro-corporate policies. If the working class demands to no longer be exploited pro-corporate democrats will say ""Oh please. Don't be so unrealistic. Your anti-corporate policies will never pass"".If history shows us anything it's that politicians don't change society via ruthless pragmatism. Mass movements change politicians due to fear of upsetting the status quo.With a mass movement we can take on the private insurance industry. ",
"The comparison with gay marriage doesn't scan because the proponents of gay marriage were forthright and consistent about their goals. By pretending that single payer healthcare insurance is just going to be a painless undisruptive ""Medicare For All"" we're being deliberately dishonest. In reality all that ""Medicare For All"" does is hitch a liberal policy goal to a currently existing government program that is popular and bares a tangential resemblance to the goal. But that resemblance is going to become unhitched under political fire. You're going to run into the same loss aversion politics that killed Hillarycare. As no less liberal a paper than *The Nation* writes:> A common view is that since every other advanced country has a single-payer system and the advantages of these schemes are pretty clear the only real obstacles are a lack of imagination or feckless Democrats and their donors. But the reality is more complicated.Even the jargon ""single payer"" is a smooth bit of nothing that serves to elide the differences between the Canadian British Singaporean German etc. systems. ""Single payer"" is an implicit argument in two words that ""everyone else is doing it so why can't we"" but in fact everyone is doing ""it"" in many different ways.",
"> Polling for universal healthcare is higher than it's ever been.After Hillary retired from SoS and before she entered the primary there were polls that said she was the most popular politician in America; by October she was the second least popular presidential candidate in polling history. Or another example: during the primary as Hillary basically refused to articulate any real criticism of Bernie for fear of losing his voters there were even polls that said Bernie could beat Trump. Polling for anything will be high if the public is only exposed to the For argument and never the Against argument. You can't pass healthcare by stealth. The Against argument WILL be articulated and when it is people will decide they don't want ""Medicare For Me.""",
"This is similar to what Obama said vs. Hillary in 2007. Hillary was the ""universal coverage"" candidate and Obama was the ""affordability"" candidate. And he made the point that what good is it mandating homeownership (for instance) if nobody can afford their mortgage?You're right that loss aversion led to the single biggest political ""hook"" that Republicans were able to sink into Obamacare. About 1 million healthy people lost their substandard plans and had to get new plans according to the new standards. And that by itself nearly sank the program politically and put Obama at risk of losing the 2012 election. Now imagine that but with 70 million people. ",
And if enough people opt-out of those insurance companies in favor of the public option insurance companies will be forced to change their plans and renegotiate their deals with doctors. The end result is that some people won't be able to keep their plan or their doctor and they'll rage that universal healthcare is to blame and should be abolished.Telling people that they can keep their plan or their doctor is not a promise the government can make because it's not under their control. Insurance companies decide what plans they offer and doctors or medical facilities decide what insurance they accept.,
>The cost increase in taxes will be below what most healthy Americans are paying now for their healthcare plans.You are good at repeating what you have heard the advocates keep saying. The problem is nobody knows if this is actually going to be true. THERE IS NO single payer healthcare plan that has received a CBO score; and independent economists (not affiliated with any presidential candidate) absolutely roasted the healthcare plan Sanders proposed in the primary saying he was deliberately promising fewer tax increases than would be needed to pay for it.Look at it this way. Would you volunteer to pay me $1000 today if I agree to pay your rent ($1200) at the end of the month? That obviously depends on how much you trust me. If you trust me absolutely it's a great deal you save net $200. If you don't trust me.. you might be worried that you'll pay the $1000 and then end up having to pay the $1200 too. Now how much do you trust Congress?,
"Jesus Christ dude. Sanders was out as of Super Tuesday. The outcome was in no way in doubt. As early as March 15 he needed over 57% of remaining delegates... while being double digits behind in the polls of every remaining state with over 80 delegates to award. Just because he didn't resign until the summer doesn't mean the game wasn't over in the spring.Obama beat Clinton in a primary system with the exact same rules ""superdelegates"" and all. You know how he did it? By winning large states. By investing those precious small-donor dollars into winning caucuses to eke out the delegates efficiently. By convincing superdelegates. By holding voter registration drives. Bernie did none of that. Instead his subreddit was obsessed with out-of-state phonebanking and photoshopping birds. I say this as an original Obama canvasser: you deserved to lose. If you couldn't beat Clinton you wouldn't have beat any Republican.",
I don't intend to disagree.  I appreciate hearing your broader perspective.  What's troubling for me are not necessarily Trump's little wins along the way but the way in which everything seems so hopelessly divided now in a way that it wasn't before. I look at the things Trump is doing and am flabbergasted at how blatant unethical and offensive they are.  Then I talk to a neighbor or relative and all they can talk about is how unfairly Trump is being treated by the media democrats and people in his own party.  They can't see why Trump is so damaging to everything he touches.  They watch different cable news are shown different stories on Facebook talk with different people about politics and it seems like we are in different worlds.  It seems like the most basic facts become subjects of debate and disagreement.  When the president makes a habit of telling frequent ridiculous and easily provable lies and a sizable portion of the country chooses to believe him because of their hatred of liberals or immigrants or the mainstream media it makes me wonder how we'll ever come back to a place of normalcy.In any case thanks for working long and hard towards this healthcare goal and for sharing your outlook.  ,
> I guess my point is that my current bank account balance and life after aren't effected by something random and unavoidable. We all get sick eventually and socio-economic status shouldn't be what keeps you living a long life.Yes maybe I'm naive but the way I see it's like the police department and fire department. We all pay taxes for their services but don't call upon them daily (or I at least hope not) but one day if we have a need then we all have peace of mind. Could you imagine if our police and fire departments were run the same way as healthcare...,
"> The law could also require that existing payments go to the employees.hate to say it but it would never pass like that. Lobbyists have too much power in Washington and it'd be silly to insist that only Republicans are influenced by lobbyists... That taint infects both sides of the aisle sadly.Of course existing employers may not pass savings benefits on but without being roped into employers grip by healthcare coverage people would have more mobility to find a job they like rather than sticking with the job they have because ""they have decent healthcare options"". This would hopefully cause new-hire pay to see the benefits of not having to pay employer healthcare premiums.Again I agree with what you wrote! Just don't expect immediate savings to be passed on to employees instead look for long term benefits as folks begin to look for better pay in their careers without the boat anchor of ""good healthcare bennies"" tied around their neck.",
"kinda.  The argument behind ""Job creators tax breaks"" is really more of a supply and demand argument.Bob is a businessman who employs 50 people making 500 widgets a week. Bob gets a tax reduction which would in theory give him more operational money to hire more folks. The problem is Bob's demand is 500 widgets a week why would he hire more people if he doesn't need them? Where does the extra money go? Well he can reinvest it into his company he can pay out bigger dividends to himself and his investors or he can give his employees raises. Some companies will give raises some will reinvest the money into their company but as we've seen from the Reagan years when the Tax Cuts for Job Creators idea really took root the employees are rarely ever given raises and it's the owners and investors who get the lion's share of the additional money.",
"Exactly!  I would never support ending a separation of church and state but the reality of the matter is that *if* we were a real legitimate ""Christian"" country whether or not people got healthcare would not be a question.  Whether or not poor children got school lunches would not be a question.  Whether or not to take in refugees would not be a question.  Whether to prioritize bombs over education would not be a question.  THOSE are tenets of Christianity what we have here in the US just a bunch of bullshit arguments about whether it's okay to limit sex education and whether it's okay for employers to deny their female employees birth control.",
We aren't the U.K. We have a much larger much more diverse citizen base. We also have a immigration problem the U.K. Doesn't have at the level we do. You can't just insert xyz system into place just because it works for some other place. Healthcare expenditure per capita in UK is half of what it is in the US.  The us by far is the leader in healthcare expenditure.Also the US is the leader in research and development spending. 10x the amount of the U.K. And 2.5x per capita.It's not the same. Failure to recognize that is naive.,
But how do you get it? By complaining on reddit? No. I‰Ûªm all for changing the crappy American healthcare system but its not like complaining on reddit is going to do anything. Reddit along with the rest of the internet has made change before and it will do it again but this literally adds nothing to the debate nor does it give someone a reason to want change if they didn‰Ûªt want it already. If you want change to happen be proactive about it. Like many other redditors have said contact your local representative. Complaining on the internet especially with no solution to the problem or no reason for wanting change to happen will not accomplish anything.,
It doesn't make any sense because you aren't running real numbers.Taking a bunch of previously uninsurable high risk super users and dumping them into an insurance system necessarily raises consumption of health resources as does making routine visits cost $0--the increase in the amount of mothers that will take their kids to the doctors for a runny nose alone will be staggering. We saw the effect of the former take the form of higher premiums for average users after the ACA.So we've established that consumption of health resources will go up. Who fronts the cost for this higher level of consumption? There are a few options--let's start with the options most charitable to your interpretation: the first option is that the profits insurance companies make is enough to offset the increase in usage--something like $13 billion total which is a lot but I'm not convinced that the offset is sufficient as insurers took a loss of $896 million the first year after Obama care came out (which is why they raised premiums). I doubt $13 billion more is what universal healthcare will cost.The second option is that it comes out of health providers' ends because the government has more negotiating power than individual insurance companies--how much more exactly? Does the government really have that much more negotiating power than an insurance company that covers tens of millions of people? How will healthcare providers respond to lower fees in terms of care quality testing and nursing staff? Is the government going to take public control of hospitals clinics and specialty centers? Do they have the capital to make that kind of buy?The third option is related to the second: the government determines a fee structure for doctors and caps it taking the shortfall out of doctors' salaries. I won't speculate as to the effect this might have but I don't think it's a very good idea.And the last option is that the taxpayer pays for it along with the massive bureaucracy it will require--will the savings in the first and second category be sufficient to offset the higher consumption so that people are paying no more in tax than they are paying for insurance right now? Truth be told I don't know and neither does anyone on Reddit. What I do know is that more people will be using health resources and the money to pay for them has to come from somewhere.,
The tide is changing and faster than I thought. I am a little right of center and I spend time around a lot of conservatives almost all of whom are Christians (which I'm not). What is interesting is that they are for the most part repulsed by what is happening to the GOP and some are considering voting (D) for the first time in their lives. Some voted for Clinton and she was the first (D) they ever voted for. I think people are genuinely repulsed.And I do think it is smart to rally the base with an issue like this. It will get people out to the polls.,
He's pretty much going to lose already but you need to remember that A.) Just because someone works in healthcare doesn't mean they don't support single payer (my mom works in healthcare and she supports it) and B.) if they could make this an appeal to working class citizens and the middle class they could outnumber those who'd be against it. It's a very big stretch though I'll admit since you'd have to find a way to break the strangehold the conservatives have on the working class here in Indiana especially through the churches.If nothing else I'd rather he supports it knowing he will lose anyways.,
If we really want to decrease the income gap and mitigate the unfair exploitation of resources and labor and tax loopholes we should switch to a flat tax rate and eliminate tax breaks/deductions.  I feel like this would be the most fair approach for everyone.  Spread the tax burden in a more even manner across all people and corporations.We should also increase sales tax on luxury goods by a small percentage and force states that don't have a sales tax to adopt one.We should even place a very small levy on high risk investing and stock brokering.There is no reason why the cost of healthcare should be the same for all income levels.  Person A making $50K per year should not have the same healthcare cost per year as Person B who is making more than person A.  I don't see any reason how paying for healthcare and education as a percentage of your income would destroy capitalism and turn us into a full blown socialist/communist country.  We just need to put a limit on what socialist programs are allowed to exist.  In my opinion those are the only two that should exist education and healthcare.  Food shelter and everything else you can buy should be 100% the responsibility of the individual.  Our society needs to have some incentive to work and do shit they don't want to do.  We can't take care of every single need of everyone.  Humans are not magically going to transcend their psyche/nature and become perfectly altruistic and work to a level that our current capitalist system operates at or could operate at.  People have to suffer or have to have the threat of suffering to some degree.,
Well that's the reasoning behind MDMA which was developed for that purpose specifically. Truth be told I think it would need to encompass many drugs that we have outlawed especially those used traditionally in medicine or religious custom. That probably should include recently outlawed drugs like DMT Salvia etc. But I don't want a blanket legalization of all drugs because some drugs are clearly a scourge on the public. We should never accept a trade in krokodil (Desomorphine) for example. I suspect a lot of opiates should be on that list. I'm not sure how best to or who is best to decide that dividing line. So I listed the drugs I listed because I think they're probably the easiest to do to realize the first steps of this dream. Step by step we will move forward.,
"I live in Australia and we have Universal Healthcare but also Private Health insurance. You don't get to ""opt out"" of Medicare even if you do pay for Private Health and I guess the rational behind this is circumstances change just because you might not need it now doesn't mean you wont need it later. And everyone uses some form of it doctors appts aren't covered by Private Health but are by Medicare same as optometrist appts. And it is like not wanting to pay the same amount for car registration than anyone else just because you only drive 6 months out of 12. What the gov't does do is charge a higher rate of tax (or Medicare Levy) to anyone over the age of 30 and earning over a certain amount that doesn't have Private Health cover. Because they are deemed to be able to afford it and an unnecessary burden on the Public Health system. ",
"Every healthcare bill is non-bipartisan. The Republicans will reject any healthcare bill offered by the Democrats so it's meaningless to say single payer won't pass because it needs Republican support. The ACA is as bipartisan as a bill could be in concept and still be a healthcare bill and zero Republicans voted for it.I do think that there should be two parts to this though. One is the solution - universal Healthcare via single payer. The second is emphasizing how the fact that people have to make a cost judgment on whether they can afford to go to the doctor or emergency room should be a source of utter national shame. The only question should be ""do I require medical care?"" and never ""can I afford it?"" ",
She had the entire party and every media network behind her along with millions upon millions of dollars and 30 years of name recognition. And she beat a nearly unknown self proclaimed democratic **socialist**. Wow how incredible or her.Let's not forget Bernie polled far better when faced against Trump from the beginning till the end. At the end of the day you center-right Dems chose a really terrible candidate one that if the election was held today would lose *even more*. She wasn't a good choice. End of story. Even if she had won what would have we gotten the TPP passed? Oh joy...,
Overall satisfaction with the healthcare system is FAR higher in countries like Canada and the UK than in the USA. Average life expectancy in Canada is nearly 3 years higher than in the USA. The USA spends $9451 per capita (2015) on healthcare compared to $4608 in Canada and $4003 in the UK. Literally every other developed country on earth has universal healthcare. Even much poorer countries like Greece Poland Cuba and others guarantee healthcare to all their citizens. The USA stands alone in the world with their idiotic system of spending far too much money to give healthcare to far too few people. ,
...I'll go slower. No worries.a) In the US we understand how government run insurance works because we have some. Our citizens over 65 our government employees and the military and the poorest people living in the US are covered by the government run insurances. That's close to a third of the citizens of the country being currently covered by government-run insurances. Still there?b) In the US we know how government run insurances work in other countries. An oyster with internet access would know too.c) Therefore we have enough data to know how it would work as the primary insurance in the country especially when 100 million Americans use such an insurance every year.,
Sanders' rhetoric can't be blamed for many decades of entrenched ideals and that would be irrelevant even if it were true.  The Americans that would be affected most by this are the poor the middle class can just make up the difference by not buying the latest iPhone.  If we break the poor up into three groups I would suggest 'minorities' 'poorly educated' and 'elderly.'  The minorities heavily support socialist ideals and the elderly are dying so I hope we can agree that the poorly educated are the ones that need to be convinced here.  The wealthy and well-to-do are already lobbying against this so we can assume that they've lost if the bill passes.  Just for the sake of argument we'll ignore their ability to 'repeal and replace.'I was raised as a middle class white in a poorish midwest town with a fair-to-middling education.  After 6 years living in socialist paradise scandinavian countries and a year in regressively conservative UK I've been converted to a full-fledged proponent of socialized healthcare even as it looks in the faltering UK system.  Americans are pigheaded and stubborn - poorly educated whites being among the worst of them - but I believe based on my experiences that the doubters faced with the reality of socialized medicine and the many subtle ways in which it improves day-to-day life through convenience and reassurance would find it to be a worthwhile investment and be converted within three or four congressional terms.The US ain't lookin so great on the global stage and the baby boomer ego is going to have to take a hit.  The American Dream is dead and gone and it's never coming back and there ain't no such thing as a superman so let's take the pain already and make the future happen.,
He said what he wants is for everyone to have input in the bill. He listed some funding ideas to get the ball rolling but really would like the idea to be embraced and worked on by the best ideas to make it work. If we can start with the idea that we want to put a man on the moon within 10 years and then made it happen we can certainly start with the idea that we are going to have working single-payer health care for all and make it work. In fact that's the way anything worth doing is accomplished.,
Well it starts with the fact that a lot people don't have any insurance at all because they can't afford even the basic coverage. Now say this person goes to the hospital for a critical emergency. The doctors and nurses will still treat that person to save his life. They are obligated too it's their job and not to mention highly immoral to just let that person die right there. Now unfortunately that person has absolutely no means to pay the expensive bill because they needed surgery and an ICU bed etc. So they default they are broke now. The hospital still needs to cover their cost so they inflate the prices of their treatments for everybody to cover the cost of all these people who show up in their emergency rooms but can't pay. That is why an Advil at the hospital is like 15$ a pill an alcohol swab 25$ and just the lights for a surgery 100$ the fucking lights only. This is the bill that insurance companies have to cover and these prices get higher and higher the more hospitals have treat people and the more people have to default. As long as you are healthy and just use your insurance for regular check ups your fine. They day you fall with a serious illness or need to get rushed to the hospital for an emergency you will get slammed by the mother of all bills. The insurance company will raise your premiums sky high to cover all these inflated costs. A cancer treatment can cost you well above 250 000$ and without it you die. Now if everybody would be universally covered these artificially inflated costs would be able to go down as hospitals don't have to absorb the cost of patients who default. Also with single payer that means that it will the government who will be able to negotiate these prices with hospitals and pharmaceutical companies at a national level insuring some consistency as well since currently prices vary wildly from hospital to another.edit: let me just add that one of the reason you can't treat the healthcare like any commodity on the free market is that in this case you don't have a choice as to whether you want to buy the product or not. When you need it if you can't buy it you will die. That is what is at stake here it's not about the money you'll save on taxes for new car a phone or even a house this is something so basic that not having it will be the end of you and in the that house car or phone you won't be there to enjoy it. ,
1.5bn/year sounds like a lot. But here's some math:Roughly 130 million US citizens pay federal income tax each year. If the federal government raised income taxes to pay for the increased cost then that 1.5bn would be supported by the 130 million taxpayers.1.5bn/130m = ~12You would see an average of $12 tax increase per year for income tax payers. $4000 - $12 = $3988 in savings.That is of course assuming they go the income tax route. If they added say a 1% increase to sales tax then your total taxes per year would be much higher but the revenue generated would also be much larger. Meaning that tax increase could also go to infrastructure repair education funding and who knows what else. Plus it's harder to avoid sales tax - even illegal immigrants pay sales tax how convenient!,
"This is a great step towards universal health care.  If it leads to single payer fantastic.  If it moves the Overton Window to allow for a robust public option or a Medicare buy-in great.But at some point Democrats are going to tackle two fundamental roadblocks:1.  How do you convince people that an enormous tax increase will actually save them money? Yes single payer would reduce overall health care spending and save money for the average family.  But it would also require the biggest tax increase in the history of the US.  As Democrats have learned in the single payer fights in Vermont Colorado and California it's much harder to sell the message of ""this will increase your taxes but it will reduce your overall health costs"" than it is to sell ""this is a huge tax increase and a government takeover of health care.""  For example [from California earlier this year](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-single-payer-healthcare-is-popular-with-1496288584-htmlstory.html) 65% of the public initially supported the proposed single payer plan but support dipped to 42% when people were told it would require a $50 billion increase in taxes.  Bernie estimated his 2016 plan would require over $850 billion in new taxes per year and (liberal) experts believe it would actually cost more than twice that.  2.  How do you convince people who are currently insured that they should give up their current plan for a new plan they know little about?  The majority of insured people are satisfied with their current insurance and do not want to make any drastic changes to their healthcare.  This was the most effective line of attack against the 1993 Clinton plan which is why Obama repeatedly promised people that they could keep their plan under the ACA.If Democrats can't come up with a workable funding mechanism that they can sell to voters the push for single payer will end up looking a lot like the push to ""repeal and replace"" the ACA.  Democratic politicians will end up running on an idea that they can't implement and Democratic voters will become discouraged and outraged.The left has a huge advantage over the right in that single payer is an actual plan that can (and does in other countries) work.  Repeal and replace was never a real plan.  But moving that plan to policy that withstands criticism and the legislative process will be extremely difficult.  This is a great start but there is much work to be done.",
"Except this skips over much of how the plan would tackle regulatory reform expanding Medicare to an actual comprehensive system for all ages instead of something geared towards retirees that regularly needs supplemental insurance how and who is going to determine payouts how that will affect the health of the medical infrastructure in place (especially rural areas) and on and on and on...Basically this is an aspirational statement that intentionally leaves anything hard unpopular or even controversial completely unaddressed to make it easy to gloss over the very large and real reservations Congressional leaders and the voters would have with any plan.In essence it is Bernie Sanders leading the Democrats to repeat the failures of ""repeal and replace"".  He's pushing an empty plan with a catchy name that polls well but has no chance of passage until someone finally decides to be an adult and do the real work of writing a full piece of legislation that a wide majority of the nation can get behind.",
"It's not fundamentally unserious politicking.Sanders has released tax and payment plans in previous incarnations of his single payer plans. This bill is essentially reviving the old Conyers bill and now that single payer is on the table for the Democratic Party he has to give a proof-of-concept in order to get backing from the moderate and centrist Dems who were previously scared shitless of single payer. This gives them cover and lays groundwork for the future.That's completely different from ""repeal and replace"" which was always a misnomer where the *only* objective was to repeal Obamacare and offer nothing in replacement. We already knew the Republicans didn't like Obamacare. There didn't need to be a proof-of-concept for the GOP to line up behind.",
You‰Ûªre right. I don‰Ûªt think they want that at all. ‰ÛÏFree market‰Ûù has become a code word for oligarch cartels and anti-consumer legislation (or lack thereof). ‰ÛÏDeregulation‰Ûù really means giving powers once reserved for the elected government to entirely unaccountable top-down corporate power structures. But that‰Ûªs not _what they sell themselves as_ to the vast majority of their constituency. Their brand is very vulnerable to subversion and destruction. We have to start calling a spade a spade when it comes to the party leadership and party platform while redefining and recapitulating the symbols they use. Start calling them what they are: anti-democracy anti-competition anti-labor anti-education...And then with the other hand offer sound policies that actually do promote democracy competitiveness labor and education. Most of their voters do want these things they‰Ûªve just been conditioned against it being possible that anyone other than bearers of the magic (R) could provide them.The illusion is cracking somewhat. Now is the time to make a land grab.,
Honestly I don't even see how they could screw it up anymore than it already is. I'm a govt employee and I have the best health insurance because it's like the ACA but on steroids. The insurance companies are very limited in what they can and cannot do. For my health care they can't claim pre existing conditions can't charge you more if you are higher risk can't just increase premiums because they feel like it etc. I'm not completely sold on single payer but both Germany and Switzerland have excellent multiplayer systems where the govt has put so many restrictions on the companies that they can't pull all the crappy things they do here. I'll end it with this how long have we been trying to get private health insurance to work in this country and how come no matter how hard we try costs keep rising and coverage keeps dropping?  How come other countries can figure out this problem but our country where we glorify capitalism and assert that everything has to be for profit can't seem to even get the free market to work in this regard?  Maybe it's because keeping somebody alive is always going to cost more than letting them just die and I don't think health insurance should be left up to pure profit. That's how we are in the situation we are in now.,
Here‰Ûªs one paper I found (you can pop the DOI into scihub if you don‰Ûªt have institutional access).http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/cep/19.4.465/full> Abstract: This article estimates the importance of health insurance coverage on the probability of self-employment. Using data from the 1993 Current Population Survey (CPS) the author focuses on the impact of having health insurance through one's spouse on the likelihood of self-employment. **The best estimates suggest that a guaranteed alternative source of health insurance would increase the probability of self-employment between 2.3 and 4.4 percentage points for husbands and 1.2 and 4.6 percentage points for wives. The author's more conservative estimates suggest that universal coverage could increase the percentage of self-employed in the workforce by 2 to 3.5 percentage points.**This is from 2001 though so I‰Ûªm sure there‰Ûªs been further investigation. I found this cited in a Center for Economic Policy and Economics report entitled ‰ÛÏAn International Comparison of Small Business Employment‰Ûù: http://cepr.net/documents/publications/small-business-2009-08.pdf> **Executive Summary:** An important part of our national identity is built around the idea that ‰ÛÒ thanks to low taxes limited regulation unfettered labor markets and a national spirit of entrepreneurship ‰ÛÒ the United States offers an environment for small business that is unmatched anywhere else in the world.> > **The international economic data however tell a different story about the state of U.S. small business. By every measure of small-business employment the United States has among the world‰Ûªs smallest small-business sectors (as a proportion of total national employment).**> > One interpretation of the data presented here is that self-employment and small-business employment may be a less important indicator of entrepreneurship than we have long thought. **Another reading of the data however is that the United States has something to learn from the experience of other advanced economies which appear to have had much better luck promoting and sustaining small-business employment.**,
What? Why would the cost of employing a person rise? There‰Ûªs less overhead that you have to pay (healthcare) less paperwork to do (nothing about healthcare...).

"JEB! Bush played that same game with his campaign in 2015. He was all coy ""I'm not sure if I'm running or not but if I were running...""And everybody said he was just doing that so that he could coordinate with the SuperPAC up until the day he formally announced.Our elections system has become such a joke. Even though I was a fan I honestly had reservations about Frankin running for office because he was like seguing his ""celebrity"" into a political career without much political experience to back it up. Now we've got Trump and Kid Rock and rumors of Zuckerberg.",
That's a perfectly valid point and I have seen proposals for Single Payer that address that.  By making it part of the law that the company continue to pay the same percentage of the overall burden as they do today this way if the cost is lower overall we all save; as well as other approaches to this issue.    It's complexities like this that made the GOP approach to ACA repeal so problematic.  So I really do want the Dems to do this the right way and do it well; which may be impossible in it'self... but it's what **should** be done.,
Let me be clear I'm personally for Single Payer so if we disagree there; that's fine.  I also know that the Democrats love to try to make arguments about health care that are about it being the right thing to do socially.  While I agree with some of those arguments they also need to make a strong and accurate argument about people's wallets.      So your example of shitting on the people with Individual plans is funny because the reason for my points about employer plans is because they are often not specifically talked about in the Health Care debate and we pretty much only talk about people on Medicaid and Individual Plans.  I was almost taking for granted that those groups would be talked about to a great degree.  ,
Hold up this isn't a lesson learned from Trump. Trumpism and Sandersism developed on parallel tracks. Bernie Sanders didn't need any lessons from Donald to become what he is. Actually the closer parallel to Sanders is Michele Bachmann or Ron Paul; all three spent fruitless careers as Congressional iconoclasts throwing rhetorical red meat to their safe-district constituencies while maintaining spotless voting records by relying on their more moderate colleagues to cast the hard necessary votes. And Bernie Ron and Michele were always more comfortable in the minority because their aim was never to actually accept the burdens of governance but to radicalize their respective political parties. The way Sanders is taking over the party is a sign of the two illnesses the Democrats are suffering under; the growth of left-wing populism and the absolute discreditation of Hillary's DLC-style centrism. Now more than ever we need an Obama but we aren't likely to get one.,
"I'm not doing that at all because I say that the bill is fine as the ""aspirational"" goal - aka the opening position. I'm just also saying that realistically some different bill will be the one that is finally passed. Same thing you are saying actually.  Also if it cost the dealership $16k to buy the car and they sell all of them between $17k and $20k if you open with $12k they'll just ignore you.  If I put in an offer on a $200000 house and open with $100000 I just don't even get a call back.  There are limits to how this all works. ",
"I would say the ending there is probably the bit you need to work on. Single payer *means* ""Medicare for all"" with private doctors and hospitals that all bill the one payer. UK's NHS is not ""single payer"" it is socialized medicine where doctors and nurses are essentially employees of the state. Canada is *sort of* single payer but on the province level not the federal level (so really it's more like ""ten payers""). Singapore and Germany aren't single payer at all they're basically the ACA done correctly. *Universal healthcare* is the term that covers all these but single payer is a specific version of that.",
"Damn you really know your shit. This subreddit and just reddit in general needs more people like you. It's sad that you have to work this hard and come up with the perfect wording in order to get any upvotes in this sub with that position....but simple hivemind comments like ""single payer is the future' get more upvotes. >By pretending that single payer healthcare insurance is just going to be a painless undisruptive ""Medicare For All"" we're being deliberately dishonest. In reality all that ""Medicare For All"" does is hitch a liberal policy goal to a currently existing government program that is popular and bares a tangential resemblance to the goal. But that resemblance is going to become unhitched under political fire. You're going to run into the same loss aversion politics that killed Hillarycare.This is spot on. On the surface it's easy to make a case....but then you get to the f#%ing details!! When you start debating about how much of increase in taxes it will cost and what will be lost when the transition happens -- that's when shit goes downhill. >Even the jargon ""single payer"" is a smooth bit of nothing that serves to elide the differences between the Canadian British Singaporean German etc. systems. ""Single payer"" is an implicit argument in two words that ""everyone else is doing it so why can't we"" but in fact everyone is doing ""it"" in many different ways.**This is perhaps the most important takeaway for any people in this sub**. This sub and most liberal redditors just thrown around 'single payer' as if just saying it means it's the cure all. There are MANY different ways healtchare is handled across the developed world and many of them are actually not that different from what Obama was pushing (assume he got everything he wanted in the ACA).  It's not as simple as 'singe payer'. What Bernie has supported in the past is basically expanding medicare for all without handling any of the cost reduction parts that all these other 'single payer' countries do. They tend to limit what doctors you can see when you can see them and for non-emergency issues tend to have a bit of a wait. There is generally a 'gatekeeper' someone that an individual needs to go through for approval to see others. I'm supportive of a more European style healthcare (or a fully functioning ACA that Obama envisioned) but it involves a lot of sacrifices that redditors aren't away of and is very difficult to achieve.  But for many redditors they just like to say 'single payer' and that's all that's needed",
She lost to a potato quality candidate. She couldn't kick the field goal in the 90s and if you go online and check who donated to her campaign there were sizeable checks from the insurance and pharma companies. Again dare I ask why you are even bringing her up?  The fat lady sang on Hillary. It is not relevant to the fact that the overwhelming majority of voters want single payer healthcare and have polled as such for a while now. The people want a New New Deal. They ain't interested in what milquetoast ideas are on offer from the DLC clique in Washington since they've pushed the same damn ideas for over thirty years. The ideology is tired. Worn out. The stupid thing would be to continue doing it when it hasn't gotten us as a nation to where we want to go in practice. I have gone from a child to a woman in the time they've had to pass single payer and they think I am stupid enough to follow in my elders' footsteps: grow old before ever seeing single payer come true and probably dying before it will ever happen.   You can't pass it by being a coward either. You can't let yourself be told by politicians many with ulterior motives (bought and paid for by the head of Aetna and the like)  that you only deserve a dinky piece of legislation that looks pathetic compared to what Australia and far poorer nations shower their people with. (Americans are not less deserving than these and I am dead dog tired of being laughed at by obnoxious Brits and the like for having a country that gives a damn about how much my employer can hold my job and insurance over my head rather than keeping me from dying of heart failure at the age of 48.)  If that is how you want to live fine by me. But don't call me a fool for wanting something better.,
I think you are pretty far off-base with that assessment.Democrats and much more so progressives are greatly concerned with the growing influence of corporate interests in the democratic party. Just look at the last presidential election. A person who has self-described as a socialistic democrat damn near won the democratic primaries. And much of the concern over their eventual candidate was her too close ties to Wall St. And anyone supporting the republican or libertarian positions has absolutely no ground on which to complain about another group representing corporate interests.And forgive me but on a slightly personal note that you find your own notions of what you imagine other people saying hilarious is something you may want give some reflection. It sounds like you're trying to turn this into a team game rather than considering what other people actually say. ,

"It's silly to make this so black and white. Obviously if you asked people if they supported $100 of their taxes going to save someone's life 99% of people would say yes. It becomes very difficult to draw a line though of how much is too much. It forces us to put a money value on the life of a person. What about a million dollar surgery to save someone's life? What about a lifetime of physical therapy for millions of dollars? Yes it sounds morally right to help everyone but I don't see how people just gloss over all the details that need to be ironed out. I'm curious about if any ardent supporters of single payer could explain possible ways of answering the question of ""how much are we willing to spend on a person?"" I doubt anyone thinks there's no limit. These should be hard rules not subjective. If not I fear that single payer care results could be affected by racism and classism.",
"As someone who has lived in both the US and Europe it is rather fair to say that Americans do not really see the benefit of their taxes. There are lots of libraries closing in the US the public education is very low quality and ""public"" University is light years away from being truly public a criminal justice system where public defenders average 10 minutes per case before people are shoved into for profit prisons. Social security Medicare and Medicaid are quickly running out of money; and the benefits that they provide is just like the average healthcare in most of Europe. ",

And optics are everything in politics.> As for the sham investigation I urge you to show me some of that rock solid evidence you claim exists because as far as I have seen it‰Ûªs a load of hogwash.The investigation started on a tip from a Trump campaign worker but that doesn't mean it isn't real.In a nutshell she's accused of lying on bank loan documents for the college she was President of (and managed to bankrupt) about donor commitments.  For example the college actually had $5 million in promised donations but she told the bank they had $15 million - I made those #s up but that's the gist of what happened.  If they can prove she knew the # provided to the bank was wrong that's a serious felony.  And it wouldn't be very hard to do so all they need is an email or meeting where it was discussed shortly prior to working with the bank.So either she pleads total incompetence at her job and takes the blame for screwing over thousands of former students and employees or felony bank fraud...its pretty ugly either way.",
It sucks when I lose a staff member because they are looking for full time hours that I can't give. It's not like I don't want to give them benefits either.  It's literally the fact that the non-profit I work for cannot afford to pay benefits.  I have 100% control of my budget and in order to give benefits I would have to cut 50% of our free community programs along with financial aid to our paid programs. I've run every model and it sucks.  The ACA is a great thing for millions of Americans and it's better than what we had before but it hurts a lot of non-profit companies that don't try and abuse the system.,
So then we shouldn't have roads? We shouldn't have a justice system? We shouldn't have police or fire departments? All of those things you're forced to pay for by paying taxes. The reality is that there is a tacit agreement to be part of our system if you are a citizen. Healthcare can justifiably be included in that. If everyone pays into a healthcare system we eliminate the bloat and profits of private insurance. Then every person has some base level of care. Every citizen doesn't have to worry about dying from something easily preventable because of how much money they have. Wouldn't that be worth being forced to pay more in taxes?,
Absolutely true and I try to be careful when discussing this that I don't make any absolute statements. Premiums SHOULD be zero and deductibles SHOULD be zero but we don't truly know that will be the case. However by removing private insurance companies and their requirement for profit from the system we can easily save billions of dollars. A big part of this will be the people who actually cut the deals and write the bill so Republicans can't be part of the process right from the start. They have continuously shown themselves to be dealing in bad faith - banning the government from negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies for instance. Why would anyone operating in our best interests negotiate that point away? As the only politician that most Americans trust on this subject Bernie Sanders must be given the leadership and authority to mold and  present the universal healthcare model. ,
My point is that we non-politicians have a job to do with this as well. Talk to those friends and family members who would be skeptical. Talk to people who like the idea and ask them to call their members of Congress.This bill is going to see massive pushback since its going directly against one of the big lobbies of DC. I'm not gonna put my trust in the media who is often partly paid by those same people to fight against the disinformation. There may be some people who speak truly of the bill either now or when they see which way the wind is blowing. But for now this has to be our job. ,

"I view ""Medicare for all"" as a marketable brand.  Even if we significantly alter what Medicare looks like if it were expanded to cover the whole country Medicare is a good brand to use.

"I personally worry that a public option would be more open to political sabotage than a single payer system would be (if it turns into an option that only makes sense for the poor and sick it'll end up being wickedly expensive for the government and subject to the same ""What if we just ignore the needy and roll around in our own piles of money?"" politics that Reagan and the 90's GOP used to gut welfare programs so effectively) but if the opening offer of single payer gets us a public option deal it'd still be an improvement over the status quo imho.",
Single payer can get quite complicated. I'll try and filter it down to make it more understandable but I may miss some stuff. Essentially with single payer you have this huge collection of people on a single insurance plan. This gives you leveraging power when negotiating prices at hospitals and clinics. As an example: IV fluids in the hospital in the US cost hundreds of dollars but in Canada cost a couple of dollars. It's because Canada can negotiate down to the lowest possible price. In addition everyone has insurance this way. There isn't uninsured people or poor people who won't pay bills and then the hospital is unable to recoup the costs from their treatment. At the end of the day the hospitals always get paid for treating patients. This puts a lower risk for them and guarantees revenue. Single payer has proven to be effective economically and provides the most overall cover medically for patients. The US system is so absurdly flawed (albeit slightly better since Obamacare than it was before) and we end up paying way more because of it. ,

"> Let's not forget Bernie polled far better when faced against TrumpThis again? Clinton's favorables were nearing 70% and then she decided to run for office. And then the opposition research and character attacks began. Her favorables plummeted. Sanders was treated with kid gloves. And not a single attack ad or conspiracy theory or slur or anything else was institutionally or professionally thrown at him unlike Clinton. I guarantee you that his opposition folder is many phone books high. And if he got the nomination he'd be subject to the same ridiculously brutal character assassination and his poll numbers would also plummet into oblivion.Here are some sobering articles about Saint Bernard's electability and the myth that ""Bernie Woulda Won!"" http://amp.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/polls_say_bernie_is_more_electable_than_hillary_don_t_believe_them.htmlhttp://www.joemygod.com/2016/11/15/newsweek-posts-gop-oppo-research-on-bernie-sander/https://medium.com/@sashastone/ten-reasons-bernie-sanders-would-not-and-could-not-have-beaten-trump-b596674c1c93https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2016/11/15/1599924/-Bernie-Sanders-past-flirtations-with-Communism-would-have-destroyed-him-in-the-General-ElectionIn truth he would have lost by a greater margin then Clinton did.Hell since 'socialist' is a four-letter word in America he is already provided an ocean of free attack ads for Republicans.

I don't disagree with you in principle but I think what is most difficult here is that your average American heavily discounts his or her need for health insurance until a health episode actually arrives. So if they're starting from the position that health insurance is largely superfluous it's quite a difficult sell to insist that our economy (indeed a substantial portion of our very government) should be overhauled to provide for that benefit. Just take a look at what happened the last times Democrats adopted a less-drastic health plan in Obamacare--they lost the white house the senate the house and thousands of state congressional seats across the country. So while I don't disagree that this isn't a bad plan in the abstract I worry that political realities will prevent it from coming to fruition.,
"I think you are misunderstanding my point here - I am not arguing that this line of thinking is correct rather pointing out that it exists. >I don't care if people ""think"" that their healthcare is good if it can objectively be shown it's garbage.There is no way you are going to see Medicare for All *seem as good to folks* as their *nice employer based coverage from the past* and therefore it's going to seem like a negative. I personally think it's a good idea and have been advocating for it myself for over a decade and so I'm just passing along the stuff I hear from people when it gets discussed. ",
"The most controversial part ( I would argue the ONLY controversial part to the public's eye) of the ACA is the individual mandate. If the dems get any kind of political muscle in the near future I don't see why the public would take issue with reforms to the bill meant to reduce premiums and expand coverage (i.e. public option reduced drug costs and a few other things but those are some huge ones). We could also take an account-payer approach (well-liked by the moderate GOP). Also the GOP isn't pushing democrats left. We had a golden opportunity to become the party of free trade increased immigration and intelligent tax reform but we squandered it in favor of protectionism populism and now socialism. Also ""moving left"" on healthcare is just a democratic equivalent of repeal and replace. The GOP attack ads will write themselves. ",

This mix is unlike anywhere else in the world on a cultural and physical level and if you think trying to fund that on a single payer basis is somehow going to be either cheaper or higher quality I have a bridge to sell you.

"Well it's not binary as you describe it.Most countries have a mix of single and multi. Often in the USA ""singlepayer"" is used as a synonym of *universal healthcare*. Major countries in the world have an universal system that is funded *mostly* by the central government thanks to taxes. In my country Italy for example we spend 3300 dollars per person (one third of what you guys spend per person in the USA +9300) and it's one of the best healthcare in the world behind a few others. 77% of ALL expanses in covered by the state and depending on the issue it goes up to 100%. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Italy#cite_note-1))The result is that you pay a bit more in taxes but you NEVER never worry about anything and everyone is covered.Technically it's multipayer as USA are (Medicare is state funded after all) but the core philosophy is clearly very different. That's what Bernie wants to change. I'm no expert so it's hard to judge these first detail but I guess you guys will be able to figure out (or simply copy!) what other countries are doing from decades. ",
I agree but I come from the UK and there's other issues that arise from single payer system.In the UK your doctor is assigned by your zip code you have littlen to no options the treatments are budgeted by the government. Routinely there's new drugs that are highly expensive but are not available in the UK and there's no option to pay out pfaense pocket.even for minor issues I had a tore ligament when I was in the UK and the doctor told me I had to rest it at the time he wouldn't do any scans and I had to argue with him to get a referral to a physio. Not to mention the physio waiting list took months.when I was in the USA and had the same injury I saw a doctor had an ultra sound got platalet plasma injections and saw a physio all within one appointment. when everyone is effectively on the same plan and the doctors and entire healthcare system is paid out from the government then things start to fall apart. Government routinely cut doctor pay In the UK and try to increase hours the system is at breaking point. I'm not saying current us healthcare system is better.. but for me I'd rather pay out of pocket and get a good service than pay the government for a mediocre service. ,
Not only do we pay the most per capita but we actually pay more *public* money per capita on healthcare than most single payer systems while falling short in both coverage and outcomes. For that reason you can argue for single payer on the basis of smaller more efficient government. It also can be billed as business friendly because most businesses biggest expense is providing healthcare to employees. And for workers it gives them economic mobility because they can change jobs or start a business without worrying about getting sick or hurt without having healthcare.There are lots of compelling economic reasons single payer is a winning policy.,
As a Canadian temporarily living in the US (military exchange) dealing with your healthcare system has been the biggest shock.  And at least I get access to military health facilities.  Care is not any different than home.  If anything we find doctors way too cautious and not forthcoming (we figured they're always worried about getting sued).  My wife spends so much time on forms.  We had a kid here months ago.  Bills still coming. I really don't get why people like this system.  We have seen a sliver off the system.  I can't imagine dealing with a terminal illness or serious injury.  Or not having insurance!And the most shocking part was finding out that the US spends double what Canada does as a percentage of GDP on healthcare.  ,
You forgot probably the biggest problem:3. Convincing companies to convert healthcare cost savings into increased salaries and/or other compensation for workers.  People won't support single payer with tax increases because they know that their taxes are going to go up and their employers are almost certainly going to take any healthcare savings and just pass that cash along to shareholders owners and top level management rather than bumping wages for actual workers.  This could be countered by minimizing tax increases for the lower and middle classes but this will cause major outrage from businesses and the wealthy who will see proportionally larger tax increases.  Unfortunately the folks with the money fund the folks who vote for policy so we all know what would happen after implementation (stagnant wages and higher taxes for the middle class rich get richer poor get free healthcare).,
"Coloradan here; Just want to add my two cents on Amendment 69 (Yes that's what it was stop laughing) You can read the whole thing on Ballotpedia: https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Creation_of_ColoradoCare_System_Amendment_69_(2016)But here's my recollection of it.The funding for the single payer option would've been done in form of a payroll tax with employers of larger business matching that and I believe some funds from Marijuana legalization since tech. the State can't dip into the surplus money (40 million is set aside for schools every year) without voter approval. (I think we just used that to rebuild roads and trails last year.)The main argument the Republicans made is that the 15 member trust to oversee and be held accountable was ""just another word for bureaucrat"" all this rhetoric about ""choice"" and no reason why people need to pay for everyone elses healthcare. Spending wasn't as huge of a talking point as people make it out to be because it was pretty solvent (ON PAPER how it would've been is a different story.)Until that point it was polling around 7-10 points ahead I want to say From my understanding the bill lost support when there were a ton of riders and restrictions in place from Birth Control Women's health Mental Health. Not only that but there was about 4 million dollars donated to groups against the amendment by insurance companies and private hospitals in the last few months before people voted on it. I was seeing a ton of bill boards and ads where I live (A Red District) just smearing the amendment in it's lead up.So Repubs hated it because -shrug- Fiscal Conservatives because it would bloat the state and have large employers paying double (But being off the hook for ACA penalties) Progressives hated it for the restrictions on the access of care and People who just read billboards thought the government was going to take their guns or something.I voted for it in hopes that it would pass but in all honesty I'm glad it didn't. I don't want a watered down system to give the rest of the country a bad idea of restrictions to access. ",
"> Yes single payer would reduce overall health care spending and save money for the average family.There's no evidence single payer reduces costs. Evidence is data plus critical analysis not just data so you can rule out possibilities. Data can point to multiple things at once so you need to rule things out.Looking just at single payer countries is not enough. Other non single payer systems outperform other single payer systems and vice versa and there are numerous factors other than the presence or absence of single payer that affects the cost of healthcare. Factors like [percent of costs out of pocket](https://imgur.com/iZhZOJ8) [median household income](https://imgur.com/R3W5fXO) and [age standardized cancer incidence rate](https://imgur.com/QWYtl4z). Not even using a crude proxy like the percent of costs that are paid by government for single payer is a good predictor as Singapore's system shows. 69-74% of Singaporean health spending is via private insurance and out of pocket costs compared to even the US at 45-50% and Singapore is among the least costly and most affordable healthcare with good results in the developed world(WHO rankings penalize countries for having out of pocket costs though which is why France is #1 and not Singapore to their rankings which just means it's a ranking of ""how much like pure single payer is this country"" and not an objective analysis.Add to this the various arguments that suggest *why* single payer would reduce costs and they're dubious:* To the idea of bargaining power United Healthcare insures 115 million people almost double the most populated single payer country in France but their per capita costs even after profits and advertising are much higher than France. Bargaining power is already rolled into the prices.* To the idea of profits profits from insurance are 16 billion a year or about 0.5% of spending. Add profits from hospitals and pharmaceuticals and it's about 4.5% of healthcare spending. We could completely eliminate profit and still have the most expensive care.* To the idea that Medicare is more administratively efficient this is merely an accounting gimmick. What counts as overhead varies country to country and the statistic ignores the 60 billion in fraud estimate for Medicare which is about 10% of its budget. Add to that that many aspects of administrating medicare such as actually acquiring and dispersing funds are done by other arms of the government like the IRS and Congress so don't fall on Medicare's balance sheet. Further you don't have as many options in suing medicare should they violate the terms of your agreement so their legal costs are artificially low. When accounting for this Medicare's administrative costs are closer to 16-20% which are in line with industrial averages.* To the idea of advertising not only would eliminating all advertising+profits still only remove 10% of spending still leaving us with the most expensive care but to claims that pharmaceutical companies spend more on advertising than R&D that is more accounting nonsense. What is actually happening is they spend more on their total SL&I budget than R&D the former of which includes advertising but also includes things like shipping and handling other logistics and paying their administrative employees. When going into the breakdown of these budgets they do spend more on R&D than advertising.* To the idea of using life expectancy as a proxy for healthcare quality that ignores that lifestyle and crime will affect those things. The US has the highest obesity rate in the developed world and a higher than average violent crime rate.* To the idea of having states try it to see Vermont did and found out it would double their budget. At first people would reasonably criticize that dismissal and an issue of having enough funds but the *bigger* issue is that the amount the budget would increase by *per resident of Vermont* was inline with the current national per capita spending average. This is an important point: making someone else pay for something doesn't reduce costs; reducing consumption does and that's what single payer does: it rations care and it rations pay of healthcare providers. To have the same manner and scope of consumption but having the government pay for it won't reduce costs which is why Medicare for All won't reduce costs it will merely obscure them.Sure they seem compelling but they don't really pass the sniff test. They pass the test of being convincing enough and eliciting the right feelings to not warrant much further investigation on the part of most people. Single payer is simply an easier political sell as it's a simple in concept for the electorate and it's expedient but there's no definitive evidence it is what actually reduces costs. It makes sense it's so popular since politics is first about what is emotionally satisfying and expedient to that effect.>this will increase your taxes but it will reduce your overall health costsExcept the budget increase in Vermont divided for each Vermont resident would have been basically the same as current per capita health spending *meaning the costs of delivering care won't go down*.>This is a great start but there is much work to be done.Can we start with demonstrating single payer is what reduces costs instead of cherry picking data and not accounting for other factors?This isn't even the level of Post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. It's using snapshot data.",

"> How do you convince people that an enormous tax increase will actually save them money? Well step one is ""don't increase taxes for most Americans""I really do wish Bernie would get used to calling out the robber barons at the top as ""billionaires"" and just use that every time he talks about who is going to pay for this. They **got** their billions on the backs of the taxpaying public so now they can give back.

> 2. How do you convince people who are currently insured that they should give up their current plan for a new plan they know little about? The majority of insured people are satisfied with their current insurance and do not want to make any drastic changes to their healthcare. This was the most effective line of attack against the 1993 Clinton plan which is why Obama repeatedly promised people that they could keep their plan under the ACA.Side by side comparison. Would you rather pay X amount for your current plan or .8 X for this very similar or better plan? Would you rather pay a $400 premium or a $320 tax? The key is to keep it simple... which is a hard thing to do. ,
Yeah these are valid points. It is very difficult to sell this. But I do wonder if as many people are happy with their healthcare now as they were in 93'. With the ACA many people had their health plans change to high deductible ones. That happened to me. My health care is currently not much different from a marketplace plan other than my monthly premiums being slightly cheaper. I do not think we would see as many people signing onto the idea of this if this wasn't the case. We also have a paradigm shift in how long people stay at one company. It used to be that you got a job someplace and kept it for decades if not until retirement outright. now people bounce around from job to job after a few years at each. In the meantime they have to have a marketplace plan. Or how about if you are one of the growing amount of people who do freelance work?I guess the point I am trying to make is that it may not be as difficult as it was in 93' but it most definitely will still be difficult. Your first point definitely valid. ,
>How do you convince people that an enormous tax increase will actually save them money? Would it be possible to require that if any business currently provides a basic health care plan for their employees that under single payer they must pass the previous costs of that on to their employees as a raise? Essentially if they're spending X dollars on wages and benefits require them to continue spending that amount under single payer when one of their costs disappears.Paying more in taxes obviously hurts but promising a wage increase for any American that currently has employer-provided health insurance would certainly help balance that out.I'd like to see them push the pro-business side of single payer more in general; it certainly helps small businesses.,
"As you've pointed out the key to reforming the nation's health care system is to confront the tidal wave of lies that special interest groups will predictably bring to bear on this debate (e.g. universal health care/single payer is ""unaffordable"" and will deny people health care access (aka fear mongering)...the biggest lies running against universal health care and single payer).  As Bernie revealed during the Democratic primary his health care proposals stand to make the American people better off by reducing their overall health care expenditures an outcome that his opponents and critics on the matter have NEVER achieved.  For instance we couldn't help but notice that Hillary is up to her usual health care industry pandering/shilling recently (SSDD) by denying that single payer is even possible in the country.  This ongoing industry pandering and capitulation from the Clinton's is precisely why they have compromised the Democratic party and country as they have for decades.In truth it makes no meaningful difference whether an American citizen funds their health care through taxes or out-of-pocket *especially* when tax-/government-funded healthcare proves to be cheaper.  It should be noted that single payer/universal healthcare *could* be cheaper since the economy of scale involved *should* result in lower costs across the board.  Naturally this requires marginalizing the army of health care lobbyists and crooked politicians in D.C. since their presence is specifically designed to deny the country the affordable and effective health care system it should have. ",
">How do you convince people that an enormous tax increase will actually save them money?""How much are you spending on your insurance premiums? If we do this you can zero that out and because everyone will be covered and we're not trying to make a profit the costs can come down.""or""We will do what other countries have done. No one in the industrialized world pays anything even close to what we do and they have better health outcomes to boot. We should not be forced to keep a system that is the most expensive and wasteful in the world and only provides mediocre outcomes.""Too many people have bought in to the notion that America's completely broken health care market is the best in the world.

What about a system in which you get the government-paid healthcare only if you opt in to pay for it's higher taxes?Would this allow people to move over to at their own will? Would they move over to it at their own will? I have amazing health insurance through my job and I don't have to pay a penny for it. That being said I **still** stress over healthcare in the event something big happens there's still a big deductible I have to pay and further expenses beyond that. If my wife and I have a baby for example we're financially screwed.,
"To propose a solution to the first question I think being clear and straightforward from the start is the best plan. The problem a lot of people have with the idea of universal health care is that they don't want to pay more taxes. When Bernie was proposing his Medicare-for-all plan during the primaries many of my friends and family in both parties saw that it would be paid with their taxes and immediately turned their nose up at the idea. The only people that learned that it could ultimately save them money were the ones interested enough in Bernie to watch his discussions of the idea or read more deeply about it and most people just dismissed it outright.When I actually talked to my friends about it and explained how and why it would simply save them money even using some of the calculator sites that the /S4P sub developed they were totally on board. The initial releases and subsequent articles on both side didn't explain the savings clearly or quickly enough. If Bernie wants this to succeed he and his supporters have to work hard to drive home the savings aspect. Make that the headline: ""You could save $1000 per year with this one simple trick!"" rather than ""Here's Bernie's universal healthcare plan that will raise your taxes (and also save you money).""",
"Sadly politicians have done very well in destroying any trust in the government.  It's very hard for congress to tell people ""You currently on average pay $500 a month for health care we're going to raise your taxes $400 a month and give you equivalent care"" and have people believe it.  You'll very quickly hear ""oh yeah bullshit they'll raise taxes $800 and provide crappy care"" and due to the history of how republicans have sabotaged Obamacare for political points and political bickering on both sides you can't blame people for thinking that.There's also the problem of how if you take the average cost of health care half of people pay less than that including a lot of rich people.  So while it's in the best interest of society as a whole it'll be a tough sell to a lot of people pay more to help others because people are jerks.Edit:  Note numbers are for demonstration purposes only.",
"The numbers are scary but kind of surprisingly they aren't nearly as bad when you divide them out. If you divide a $850 billion cost by the roughly 156 million people in our labor force Sanders' plan would need every working American to contribute about $5449 per year. To put that in perspective for my medical insurance I pay $135/month. Now you might think ""that's only $1620 per year under Sanders' plan you need to pay an additional $3829 per year!"" but that's not true at all. My company pays $540/month to allow me to have health insurance at that cost. In other words without my added investment my company is already investing $6480/year on my behalf to provide me health insurance. If we have universal health care that $540/month could easily go to my salary instead. The upshot is that once you factor in how much the company and current government currently pays to supplement our insurance Sanders' plan isn't only feasible but the $850 billion price tag is actually *cheaper* than the existing system. In fact even if the more pricey estimate were correct raising the cost of his health plan to twice the estimate it would be a mere $2700 in taxes per person per year well under the per-year deductible of almost any healthcare plan. In addition my healthcare plan doesn't cover dental vision or other things that would likely be covered under a universal single-payer system reducing that effective cost even further and offering even more relative savings.",
"To your first point I'd say show people some real math. How much will their taxes go up per year? How much will they save per year on health care? Come up with some estimated averages and roll that into a simple talking point that gets repeated until it sinks into the public consciousness like ""Average savings of x $$ per family."" This worked great with the $15 minimum wage. It's become part of the national conversation.To your second point I'm assuming people would still be able to purchase private insurance to supplement whatever they get from the single-payer system. I disagree that most people who have insurance are satisfied. Every single insured person I talk to is angry about high copays and deductibles confusing bills and sub-par medical treatment.Definitely reminding people that it's already working in other countries should be a point that gets hammered. ",
There are several other fundamental issues that need worked out:1) Insurance companies albeit at a much too high of cost manage all of the actuarial risk contracts and payments to a variety of provider groups. How will the government take this over and will they be any better at it than a private company? 2) Even in today's Medicare world a full third of patients supplement insurance with private insurance. How will this be implemented?3) What happens to Medicaid and where does it go?4) What is the true economic impact on businesses? There are going to be loses and winners here. Do companies offering shit plans today reap the benefits? Do we force companies to offer suplimental private insurance?  Will companies just pocket this money and people pay higher taxes lowering take home pay overall.Not that you are wrong but when you mention the state bills they didn't fail for reasons you are mentioning. Colorado's for example never gained support because the oversight structure and language in the bill was so poor no one even gave it much of a chance. ,
Your argument is based off the assumption that there would be no other ways to cut healthcare costs. Current healthcare prices are grossly out of proportion to what they should be due to obamacare and other regulations such as the innability to buy equivilant prescription drugs from other countries and markets.Any tag hike that would have to be large enough to cover such an expensive program would be far costlier than what americans were pay if they had affordable less regulated healthcare.The solution isn't a governmental system but to de-regulate the market and let people truely take control of their own health and make whatever decisions they want about it.Until that happens we will never see cheap healthcare and a government funded option would bankrupt this country while big pharma and the politicians made a killing off of it as they would be able to charge the government even higher prices for the medications that consumers and current insurance companies wouldn't be able to pay.,
[According to this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/23/heres-how-much-the-average-american-spends-on-health-care.html) we spend $3.4T/yr on medical care. I do not understand why there needs to be any increase in taxes if insurance companies are eliminated from the equation. It seems to me this is a matter of eliminating some outdated companies that serve no purpose and redistributing the money that they suck out of the economy to healthcare for Americans. It makes zero sense that there would need to be any increase in taxes especially considering that we already know that we spend more per person that any other country and universal healthcare would cost less per person.,
Speaking as a Californian our state taxes are already so much higher than most of the country.  People really do move out of the state and take their profitable businesses with them because it saves them millions in taxes every year.Lower income people barely scrape by with our high cost of living.I can see why there was faltering at the tax increase.  The increase needs to be spelled out.  Will it be like Medicare and our disability taxes where everyone pays in the same rate up to a certain maximum (with higher earners getting a break?). Will it be by shifting the income brackets?  Or by increasing the rates? Or removing certain tax credits from the system?,
">It isn't quite like the GOP's Repeal and Replace because Sanders has offered ways to pay for itHe hasn't been honest about the costs. His primary plan (which was when I stopped taking him seriously) assumed a mathematically impossible savings in prescription drug costs. He pretends that you can build a single payer system just with tax increases on the rich when literally no SPH in the world does this they all have a much broader base. Sanders' plan is perhaps not a 100% analog to the ""repeal and replace"" slogan it's more like the AHCA before it got its first CBO score: lots of empty promises about how it definitely won't go wrong in the ways it will obviously go wrong as soon as someone pulls out a calculator.>The GOP never had a coherent replace plan that half or more of them were behind.That remains true of ""MFA"" since less than half of Democratic Senators have endorsed it.",
It also won't be a serious conversation because the one thing the Republican party does well is messaging.  They have no good ideas.  They have no clue how to function as a governing body but Frank Lutz and his team get these men and pretty blonds on FoxNews on message.  They have a very larger portion of the country believing that everything the government does is evil.  They convinced people that the ACA was a government take over of healthcare and that was enough to flip the house  the Senate and state legislatures all of the country.  It also enabled republican run states to not allow the ACA to function properly denying healthcare to millions without rioting in the streets.  We won't have a serious conversation about single payer in our lifetimes.  I hope I'm wrong but I just don't see it.,
Because that shows a serious attempt at actually figuring out how to implement this. The Republicans screwed up by not trying to figure out how to replace the ACA until they were out of time and had to rush a bad bill that no one liked.The Democrats should learn from this and start putting down the foundation for what they would like to do. This would also make them more than just an obstructionist party. Of course the problem then becomes that they're negotiating against themselves but this is necessary in order to allow for a united party to push for the final bill.,
Im 100% sure it won't even get a vote.  But you have to make a full bill to have an accurate measure of Congressional and public support.If you make a nice outline that ignores the many hard decisions moving our system would require - and ignores funding totally - you can't really say you have wide support for an actual system because you haven't broached the subjects that generate debate.The bill as written couldn't actually be used as a working healthcare bill.  Even ignoring funding this bill quite simply lacks the details needed to make a SP system work.  As such it's an empty stunt.,
Nah.  In both cases you have politicians pointing towards  aspirational goal legislation that is intentionally absent any real details that might cause divisions in congress and with the electorate.  In both cases they use these shell bills to make it seems like they have built a consensus but in reality have kicked the can on anything that might generate debate.As such neither shows what the realistic level of support is for their specific policy.  And as such the dems risk over promising on something they cant deliver and/or would be reviled once the public gets to see an actual bill.It's repeal and replace all over.  And that's disgusting.,
Obamacare is already universal healthcare or it would be if every state accepted the medicaid expansion. After all France and Germany have similar systems and most people call those programs universal. The only difference is that they also have lots of other regulations that reduce the cost of healthcare that we don't have in the US. Sanders' plan doesn't do anything to reduce costs. It's a huge upheaval of the medical system with massive risks and it ultimately doesn't even end up covering more people or do anything to reduce the costs of healthcare. And if it fails it'll kill the Democratic party's chances of winning an election for decades.Single-payer is a catch phrase. There's nothing about having the government be the only one who pays for healthcare that makes it cheaper or have better results. Dozens of other countries have fantastic multi-payer healthcare systems but the far left has an ideological attraction to centralized policy even if it doesn't actually work better. The simple fact is that US is a very decentralized country and a decentralized healthcare system will be significantly easier to pass and probably be more effective as well.,
I don't mean to be rude but this is getting really aggravating. Sanders released a tax schedule *two years ago* when he got on this issue in the primary. It's on GovTrack it's on his own campaign website. People who are left wanting for a plan to pay for the program aren't looking hard enough -- which is to say they weren't looking at all.This particular bill doesn't have a tax plan attached to it. I'm guessing to give cover to the more moderate Democrats who would flip their shit at the thought of raising taxes to pay for public programs.,
I'm curious why you didn't reply to the other commenter who pointed out that this is a sound political move because it shows that Dems can work together on a real plan while Republicans flounder to even repeal the ACA they've been demonizing for years.You'll never get anything put through if you just sit and wait for it to be politically feasible to pass something. This move is further pushing the idea of universal healthcare into the national zeitgeist. The more it's out there and people are talking about it the more we can strip away the negative connotations and baggage that have been loaded on the idea to slow it down. This leads to more popular support which leads to it being politically feasible to pass it. Politics isn't a one step process.,
You can do that but they're too adept at slinging the accusations right back.It doesn't matter if it's true or not. All that matters is they muddy the waters and if you take the position that you're the one who's righteous ANY indication otherwise is a big win for them.They play this game constantly. That's why you hear all this 'both sides' bullshit up n down the block.Dems need to figure out a good counter to it.Rational and factual arguments only work when the people you're giving them too actually care about facts and rationality in the first place.When you get to a point where your position is untenable as is often the case for right wing ideologies you HAVE to abandon both reason and logic.,
Just one of many situations (like healthcare) where the free market fails. Too often libertarian/conservative economics rely on lab conditions not real world conditions. They want to abolish the minimum wage because they think the market will determine it. Well no because people need jobs. It's not the same as Kroger and Safeway both charging too much for cheese. People can't just not get a job like they can just not get expensive cheese. Same with healthcare. People want it and need it so they'll pay what they have to. All that favors the business owners and insurance companies and hurts the people. ,
"> Even though I was a fan I honestly had reservations about Frankin running for office because he was like seguing his ""celebrity"" into a political career without much political experience to back it up.I don't know what you mean by without much political experience.

It is the individuals we have issues with. ",
The system is sustainable from a systematic point of view but not from a personal perspective. Each and every person I know who is against single payer did not witness the horrors of our broken system personally and have no empathy for those who did.   It is depressing to think there are so many of those out there. Even those that are very very well off who know very well they are one disease away from being destitute still won't come around.  On a positive note my friend whose little girl has a preexisting condition is starting to agree with single payer and even hold on to your hats admits that Obamacare might not have been that bad and that he has personally benefited from it.,
"What we currently have is not a market option. It's a voodoo option. Nobody has any idea why a box of bandages costs $300. There's no market force attached to the absurd prices we pay for. It's a kabuki theater between hospitals and insurance. Hospital tells the insurer ""OK that kidney stone removal cost $10000"" Insurer says ""We're not paying more than $5000"" Hospital hits back ""$9000"" insurer gives in ""Fine $8000 final offer"". That is how a kidney stone removal costs $8000 and depending on your insurance policy you will pay 0-20% of that $8000.  There was no examination of how in-demand kidney stone removals were. No real market forces at work. Just a lot of back-and-forth between insurers and hospitals which greatly inflates the prices of simple procedures. Not to mention the insurance overhead. If we had a real free market system patients would be able to go online and shop around for operations. Hospitals would transparently list the prices for operations and compete for patients with discounts. ",
Healthcare violates several assumptions that form the basis of a free market.Here are a few:- consumers typically do not have complete information. This is because the product is complex (i.e. I don't know the details of the services I am purchasing because I am not a doctor). Additionally consumers often can't easily shop around because they need urgent treatment (e.g. broke a bone) or they can't travel to other locations (e.g. it's expensive to fly).- consumers don't make rational decisions when their life is on the line. You'll pay more than you should if you're going to die.- barrier to entry is high. Starting a company to compete with existing healthcare providers requires a lot of capital.http://www.triplepundit.com/2011/12/fallacies-free-markets/,
Well the evidence is that every other developed country provides better healthcare for less money than America. So on average everyone will benefit. There may be individuals that are lucky enough to be healthy and accident free and get cheap insurance with high deductibles they never need to pay. These people will probably end up paying more under single payer. You could call  it getting screwed if they are forced to contribute to healthcare they don't use through taxes. They are also getting a lower risk coverage since they are protected should they ever get sick or hurt. In the same way we are screwing people by forcing them to contribute to social security when their retirement savings get a higher yield on the stock market. Or when they pay taxes to unemployment benefits but never find themselves unemployed. The government is forcing people to be protected from unforeseen tragedy like stock market crashes or layoffs. This has a cost but also an obvious benefit. Single payer would also protect people from unforeseen illness. It's am important part of the social safety net the America currently lacks. ,
I won't lie I was originally vehemently against any sort of national health insurance because honestly....we hear about the horrors going on at the VA and that's government run health care right there.  How can they handle it on a far larger scale when veterans are getting the shaft left and right now?  But then again I and a great many like me are getting the shaft anyway with our insurance from work that costs a ton of money and doesn't pay for anything until we hit some absurd number out of pocket.  I think my family's plan is ten grand or whatever out of pocket before Cigna will pay a dime.  So we are already getting fucked.  May as well let the government handle it.  We will probably still get fucked but maybe the insurance companies will get a bit of a pinch from it also.  ,
"Canada. Canada is considered ""single payer"" but many people (including me) have supplemental coverage through our private plans provided through our employer or elsewhere.If I understand correctly the thing that makes it ""single payer"" despite there existing private insurance is that the service provided dictates how it's paid for. If I go to the ER for an emergency or if my doctor orders an MRI it will be paid by the single-player provincial insurance even if I have private insurance. If I go to the dentist or get a massage or other medically-related things that my private insurance covers I can use the private insurance.",
Yeah. Someone who promotes policies which help the working class and are proven to work in other countries is the same as someone who promotes harmful policies to the working class.This is probably one of the biggest false equivalences I've ever heard. Medicare for all is not some pipe dream. We already have medicare. There are already countries with similar systems.The democrats are suffering exactly because they don't represent the working class. The democrats will offer bold pro-corporate policies like the TPP...But then say bold working class policies are too much!I pray that the democratic party does not listen to you. More neoliberalism is not the solution.,
> False. More people coming out was only part of the fight. It was actually the biggest part of the fight. As soon as they started coming out the trend started changing rapidly. >The same conversation can be had with healthcare. People who NEED access to quality affordable care because they are sick or dying can make very poignant arguments about why people should support Medicare for All.Giving gay people the right to marriage cost the straight people basically nothing. It changes nothing in their life. Transforming healtchare will cost almost everyone something -- it will come with HUGE tax increases. There will be some winner and some losers in the net result. If giving gay people the right to marriage was attached to a 5% tax increase for all you would certainly have seen little progress. ,
"> It's not as simple as 'singe payer'. What Bernie has supported in the past is basically expanding medicare for all without handling any of the cost reduction parts that all these other 'single payer' countries do. They tend to limit what doctors you can see when you can see them and for non-emergency issues tend to have a bit of a wait. There is generally a 'gatekeeper' someone that an individual needs to go through for approval to see others.Actually as a Canadian who lives in one of the only countries that has something that actually resembles a single payer system pretty much every single thing you listed here is not true (but is true of other countries that *don't* have a single payer system or something akin to one). There is no limitation on what doctor I can see (other than the fact that doctors won't take unlimited new patients) no limitation on when I can see my doctor (other than the hours she works obviously) and we have wait times for non-emergency procedures but it's a myth that the wait times will substantively increase because when it comes to non-emergency procedures most Americans already have extremely long wait times.There is a talk radio show I listen to the host just said he had to go in for a blood test and another simple non-emergency procedure at the hospital recently he waited 8 hours to do it. You can't just waltz into the ER and get a blood test in 15 minutes here but our wait times are no worse than that. The only difference is that he had a copay and the bill given to his insurer was *two thousand fucking dollars* just for that. Most of that is what they charge you just to walk in the door. My father got his knee replaced last year he waited 6 months to do it. It's an optional surgery so I don't know why you would actually need it to be done immediately unless you are willing to pay an enormous sum for the privilege he didn't have a problem with waiting the surgery went smoothly with no complications his knee is great now and he paid NOTHING for the surgery. And I mean nothing our tax burden here is *lower* than what they pay in NY already NOT including health insurance premiums.There is also no such thing as a gatekeeper here. I don't talk to anyone to get care. If I want to see my doctor I call and make an appointment. If she's not working I walk into literally any walk-in clinic anywhere in the entire province that is open (with no charge). If I have a health emergency I walk into literally any ER in the entire province with no charge and no requirements (other than my health card which also has no charge to acquire or replace).Personally I think the things you listed *are* bullshit I wouldn't want to deal with them and I think they are excellent arguments for why other developed country's health systems have major problems which would be an especially tough sell. Obviously no health system is perfect and I'd love to see certain improvements here (eg dental) but I love our system and I am EXTREMELY opposed to any hack who tries to take us down any path here other than single payer and so is almost everyone else in this country.I also don't agree at all that a single payer health system can have no mechanism to reduce cost. In a single payer system you have all the leverage possible because EVERY customer in your entire system can be unified in negotiation of costs (and government can just set cost levels by law). You also have the largest risk pool possible which in and of itself is a HUGE cost reduction mechanism. I mean christ the US already spends more than DOUBLE what Canada does per capita on health which doesn't even touch the actual cost of health premiums even after PPP adjustment. We also spend less than Switzerland Netherlands Germany and Denmark (and others).Just to conclude it is SO easy to shit on everyone else's ideas you don't even have to be accurate to do it. You have painted a very excessively negative view of single payer and the situation in the US I'm not really sure why. There don't have to be as many sacrifices as you are making it sound and a system properly implemented has every ability to save HUGE amounts of money from what the US currently spends as well as for most if not all people in the country. It's not even clear that taxes need to go up everywhere (the 'welfare queen' states with unsustainably low rates and net negative output notwithstanding). $4600 per person vs $9600 PLUS premiums PLUS you have 10x the risk pool and negotiating power. This isn't some massive burdensome layer of cost on top of everything else you have the potential to save literally trillions of dollars while massively increasing your health outcomes. We literally have higher life expectancy which means more of the costliest years of life for every person in the country yet we STILL pay less than half per person with zero health insurance premiums.Don't get stuck on the convoluted and restrictive systems in the EU many of them eg Switzerland which is arguably most similar to the ""ACA done properly"" model is quite restrictive relies on out-of-pocket costs to reduce health care costs by forcing people to pay huge sums of money to use the system and thus often choose to just accept the health consequences of not using it (or subsidize public health spending with hidden costs) AND still spends like 50% more per capita than Canada. Their health outcomes are only marginally better in most metrics and I suspect that they would have serious problems with the viability of their system (and the strength of their metrics) if they actually allowed any amount of substantial immigration like Canada and the US.",
"One thing about the economic analyses is that they're almost always wrong.   The economy is too complex to predict. I think the Modern Monetary theorists are correct so the Federal government can afford to let deficits/debt rise a lot higher than many economists would be willing to push for i.e. inflation is a theoretic risk much overblown.So to do this politically just change the Medicare laws to age=conception and then let things sort themselves out deal with issues as they arise make adjustments but let the Fed cover it all while in this period.I think it can be done precisely because people will think of it very simply.  After all the more complexity introduced up front to try and anticipate all of the outcomes is how and why HillaryCare and Obamacare failed. (I'll be 51 in a couple months and remember it well.)  But if you get enough people behind it and pass it ""as is"" the insurance/pharma lobby can be overcome and as things work out as it goes along that lobby will be less and less powerful. (The goal being to reduce or even eliminate private insurers--there will always be an option for the rich to buy their way into superior health care but most people shouldn't need it.)  Medicare for all puts it beyond state politics and insurance finagling (the two big problems previously).Edit: typos",
>And a united Democratic party in message and purpose can change that.>People don't give a fuck about the nuts and bolts of policy. Why do people keep assuming they do.>>Find a good message and hammer that baby home. Stop trying to explain the underlying model of healthcare and blah blah blah.... Use impactful emotional rhetoric (as long as it's grounded in reality) that's why the GOP is so powerful and the Democratic message is so weak. So basically decide that single payer is the only way to go and demand it instead of actually looking at what might be the best and most affordable way to achieve universal coverage in the US? Maybe the answer is single payer maybe it isn't but we'll never know if we skip that part of the discussion. I thought dogmatic adherance to a policy idea no matter what was something that Democrats were against. ,
"The democratic party is bought by corporate interests. Look at the money. Is the democratic party more liberal than the republicans? Sure. But that doesn't make them automatically really progressive.

The democratic voters have always been more progressive than the establishment.>And anyone supporting the republican or libertarian positions has absolutely no ground on which to complain about another group representing corporate interests.Of course. But we should be able to hold Hillary Clinton accountable for her terrible anti-progressive positions.

"I think the more important point is that it's not going to work. Yes there is currently 57% polling support for ""Medicare For All"" because as I said *Medicare is a currently popular government program.* [But the moment people are exposed to the most anodyne right wing talking points like ""the plan could extend government control over healthcare"" support drops to 40%.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/12/single-payer-democrats-litmus-test-bernie-sanders-215600). So the point is not whether we can agree that it's a cynical trick or a ""comprehensible bridge to a political future"" (which I would contend is just a way of rewording ""cynical trick"" btw). The point is that the bridge falls apart the moment there is somebody on the other side arguing against it.",
Wasn't expecting any inspiration out of this but damn thanks! It's definitely a struggle though for real. I'm a freelancer in CA so when I lose my health insurance (in two months - currently covered by my father's) I won't have any employer to sponsor insurance for me. My options at this point seem slim. Pay my bills and don't have insurance? Give up the dream get  a shit job just so I can have insurance? Not a good situation either way - but definitely not willing to give up the good fight. Hopefully something good comes out of all this soon. Either way I'll keep voting and keep supporting those that care about the people. Cheers man!  ,
Vermont magazine Seven Days reported Tuesday that the 74-year-old senator and his wife Jane Sanders have purchased a four-bedroom house on the shore of Lake Champlain for roughly $600000. Jane told Seven Days that they had recently sold a house in Maine that had belonged to her family since the 1900s and used the proceeds to purchase the new property which is located in North Hero (population 803 as of the 2010 census). With this purchase Sanders now owns at least three houses the others being in Burlington VT and Capitol Hill in D.C.Sounds reasonable to me. The dude has been a representative for nearly 30 years. If that's all you have to complain about I'd say he's done quite well.,
Hey I pay those taxes too and have been paying them every year of my adult life. They are socialist programs that made our society better. It's time to update them because things have changed. Where I live (San Diego) the income gap has widened while availability of affordable housing has decreased. This has led to a massive increase in the number of homeless who have created a shanty town in part of our downtown area. It was all fun and games for awhile but now there's a fucking Hepatitis outbreak. I live in what is supposed to be the nation with the highest standard of living in the world but I have to be careful of where I go to make sure I don't get an entirely preventable disease. It would be fucking nice if some of my taxes could go toward making sure these types of things don't happen. ,
I'm not talking about affordability I'm talking about outcomes.  There is a very real and significant risk that it takes the US government a decade or more to implement a system that can come close to the healthcare coverage that I have.  There is the complete possibility that this gets passed there is a huge backlash and Republicans then control it and dismantle it in ways beyond our imagination.  Single-payer is probably the dumbest way of going about Universal Healthcare that we could possible conceive it ignores our current system the risks involved the unintended consequences (ie: collapsing insurance markets before it can be fully implemented as just one example) and ignores the fact that the US has probably one of the only governments where half of the elected officials believe that government is the problem and doesn't work.  Universal Healthcare is something that we all want probably from right of center to far left.  But let's take the surest and most efficient path to get there which would be a multi-payer system with a public option.,
> Savings from health tax expenditures.Revenue raised: $310 billion per year. Several tax breaks that subsidize health care (health-related ‰ÛÏtax expenditures‰Ûù) would become obsolete and disappear under a single-payer health care system saving $310 billion per year.Most importantly health care provided by employers is compensation that is not subject to payroll taxes or income taxes under current law. This is a significant tax break that would effectively disappear under this plan because all Americans would receive health care through the new single-payer program instead of employer-based health care.His biggest line item except his payroll tax is speculative.  $310000000000/annum is $1000 per person in the country per year.  > A 2.2 percent income-based premium paid by households.Revenue raised: $210 billion per year.This year a family of four taking the standard deduction can have income up to $28800 and not pay this tax under this plan.A family of four making $50000 a year taking the standard deduction would only pay $466 this year.That's a 10% tax hike on what you're paying to the government now if you make under 70k/yr. He's replacing a $3000000000000 plan with a plan that is funded for $1380000000000 per year.  What if the new plan costs nearly as much as the old?  What if it costs 2/3 as much. His plan could have a $700000000000 budget shortfall even if he saves 1/3 of the cost of the ACA.Generally speaking I don't like buying something when a politician tells me what it's going to cost.  I don't trust the price quote but I'll let you make your decision.,
"The person I was responding to just said ""This will cost a trillion dollars"" without context. You know who does shit like that? Every republican and centrist liberal who wants to oppose single payer; either ideologically or to protect vested business interests. If you say ""This will cost 1 TRILLION DOLLARS"" without mentioning that it currently costs 1.3 trillion then you are trying to scare people with large numbers. As to your comment what was technically wrong about my comment? Single payer is cheaper. Not just cheaper per person using it; it's cheaper overall. With single payer you can cover 100% of people and it will still shrink the cost to the overall economy. You also get better outcomes for people that do use it. It's been proven true in every major nation -- their healthcare costs constitute a smaller portion per capita while still covering everyone. ",
Well yeah. He lost. Although he had a lot more cards stacked against him at the start of the race and never got the media coverage he deserved so it's no surprise he lost. What's surprising is how well he did do. He went from a virtual unknown to winning over 40% (I forget the exact figure...44.2%) of the Democratic primary vote and he did it with almost zero media coverage.  I would agree that he was a terrible candidate at the start of the 2016 primary if only for the fact that he was completely unknown compared to Hillary.  But the fact that he did as well as he did despite starting in a much more handicapped position and without favorable media exposure and against the Clinton/DNC machine says to me that he's a fantastic candidate who would have destroyed everyone if given the exposure he deserved. Look at his approval numbers in VT to see how well he represents his constituents.  Look at the percent of REPUBLICANS in VT who support Senator Sanders.  It's crazy.  ,
You can rip on Canada all you want but Canadians aren't looking to ditch their health care for an American type plan -  which is really no plan at all. Canadians report greater satisfaction with their doctors greater life expectancy lower infant mortality lower maternal mortality fewer deaths from non-communicable diseases cardiovascular diseases and injuries. Ultimately wait time is just one vector in health care and not necessarily the most important. Our cancer mortality is marginally better but for that and lower wait times you willing to accept uncontrolled medical costs? What good is great medicine if you can't access it?,
I feel like I should interject right here. I'm from the UK. My Grandma needed her knees replaced due to cartilage deterioration. She had a scheduled operation but it was cancelled because they needed the OR due to an accident nearby. She was in surgery 2 days later. My mum was diagnosed with Breast Cancer 2 years ago. The time it took from diagnosis to operation to remove the lump was less than a week. She started Chemo within 3 weeks of her diagnosis. She had chemo for a year and is currently cancer free. All of this with zero cost. My ex had a weird sounding heartbeat and so went to the doctor. Turned out his aortic valve wasn't closing properly and so his heart was having to work twice as hard and would eventually fail. So he needed to to have his valve replaced. At the time he was 24 a college dropout and a waiter. He was taken care of 100%. He spent around a week in hospital and then had some aftercare for around 6 months afterwards. My FIL is American. He got a cut on his foot that he let get sceptic and eventually his leg needed to be fully amputated. His kidneys also shut down and he needed dialysis. He was in hospital for about 3 weeks before his health insurance ran out and he was forced out. There was zero aftercare zero rehab because he didn't have enough money. He actually passed away about a month later not through medical complications but he just gave up. He was 67. It might not all be flowers and puppies but it saves lives and it's incredibly fair. My grandma had to wait because what she needed wasn't more important than someones life. My mum was taken care of incredibly well and quickly. My ex might not have been able to get the treatment he needed to save his life in the US. ,
This happens in America and we pay significantly more. It's a myth that Canada and other countries have these ridiculous wait periods. Canadians aren't coming to America for treatment. It is factually cheaper to leave America and pay out of pocket to have a surgery in Thailand versus having a surgery in America and that includes round trip air fair.Our cancer treatment is better because we have more fucking cancer patients and everything America consumes and uses causes cancer. Of course cancer treatment is high. We also have a fucking opium epidemic because of said cancer treatments and other preventable illnesses that could be avoided with a better health culture but Americans would rather argue against their best interests.It is insane the level of propaganda that people from the United States eat up just so they can tell themselves that their way of life is the only way to do things. ,
"This- people need to understand that federalizations of ANYTHING leads to government rationing. So yeah- hope anyone that supports this likes waiting lists. People also don't understand that NOTHING is ""free"". The doctor that goes to school for 8 years should be able to dictate his own pay. One of the greatest minds on Capitol Hill Rand Paul even goes as far as equating Universal Health Care with Slavery:""It means you believe in slavery. You are going to enslave not only me but the janitor at my hospital the person who cleans my office the assistants the nurses ... You are basically saying you believe in slavery.""1""With regard to the idea whether or not you have a right to health care you have to realize what that implies. I am a physician. You have the right to come to my house and conscript me.""""...Our founding documents said you have a right to pursue happiness but there is no guarantee about physical comfort. When you say you have a 'right' to something there is an implication of force ...""http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/272-39/5941-rand-paul-universal-healthcare-is-slavery",
This is an excellent point.  I suspect that we actually differ in our political views but trying to marry single-payer healthcare and the American lifestyle is my biggest concern.  I can tell you without a doubt that most Americans treat their bodies with zero respect and expect exceptional performance.  Basically do whatever they want and freak out at any discomfort/physical inconvenience.  It will be a nightmare to support them (although really we already do because in my experience those patients almost NEVER have insurance that wasn't government provided.)I am still very hopeful that we will make this transition but I think we need to really focus on retraining that mentality and teaching younger people about health.,
"Post 2 of 2:>>Social Security>>You mean how fraud is so high they refuse to even give a ballpark estimate because it would instantly become a massive political issue? How about the fact that they state they don't have the manpower to combat the amount of fraud they have to deal with and so much of it goes uninvestigated? Ah yes the Washington Times. Such a reputable source. But at least they seem to be quoting a relevant person so I will still address it.It's weird that Sean Brune says now they can't give an estimate as [the same group estimated in 2014 that fraud abuse of SS was below 1%](https://www.congress.gov/113/chrg/shrg95582/CHRG-113shrg95582.htm). Perhaps he is trying to politicize it with statements like that? I don't know.Second your comment about combating fraud is odd because it points to the easy solution of hiring more people to track down fraud which would be counter to your view of decreasing the government.Third SS fraud is really small. Out of a $900 billion program [it only estimates about $3 billion in improper payments](http://www.crfb.org/press-releases/fact-sheet-how-much-waste-fraud-and-abuse-there-social-security) or a 0.4% fraud rate. Moreover [it's extremely difficult to even qualify for SSDI](https://www.cbpp.org/blog/disability-insurance-has-many-safeguards-against-fraud-and-abuse) as there are many requirements needed to even get in to the program.Finally as I've said in about other government programs [there are equivalent levels of fraud in private employee benefit plans run by businesses](http://www.louisplung.com/images/news/employee_benefit_plan_fraud_cases_ppt.pdf) showing that private industry is again no better than public funding. That is also not accounting for all [the shenanigans private companies did to get rid of their private pension liabilities in the first place](http://www.alternet.org/story/152549/how_companies_plunder_and_profit_from_the_nest_eggs_of_american_workers).>>Earned Income Credit>>Yeah 25% of the entire program being payed out fraudulently that's what I think of when I think of ""efficiency"".Another reputable source the Washington Examiner. Again your source claims all improper payments are fraud which is not true. In fact estimates say that most of those error payments are because of the confusing nature of the tax code on EITC and verifying status rather than on fraud and abuse in claiming the benefit. Meanwhile business fraud supposed to be reported as income on individual tax returns exceeds 60% per year and costs over $100 billion in Los tax revenue. And if we really wanted to fix this program (which we should) Congress should give broader authority to the IRS to reduce improper payments. [Source for all this.](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/reducing-overpayments-in-the-earned-income-tax-credit)>How is it dishonest to state that I would like to see it successfully implemented in at least a few states before it's forced down the throats of the entire nation which could have catastrophic budgetary consequences? It's dishonest because you've already made up your mind that the government can never be efficient which is a bias. Government could be just as efficient or more so than the private sector in many areas if given a chance. Unfortunately Republicans have a theory of 'starve the beast' i.e. cut programs and then claim they are ineffective due to lack of funding and thus justify further cuts. It's ridiculous logic because of course a program can't succeed if it is underfunded. How about instead of trying to cut government funding we work to make the tax dollars more effective? I'm all for reforming all of these programs to make them better but I don't see a reason to get rid of them entirely or even significantly cut them. They do good and if we as a country worked together they could do even better.>We're already $20000000000000 in debt. That's not called dishonestly that's called logic and rational skepticism you should try it some time [And our private debt is nearly 200% of our gdp](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/private-debt-to-gdp). Our government is just a reflection of the problem at large with US society; we take on too much debt to fund growth. Also by bringing up the debt you fail to mention that [a great way to fix it would be to raise taxes over cutting spending](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/business/economy/03view.html) thus 'increasing the government'. So yes I still call you intellectually dishonest because you are only looking for sources that confirm your already preconceived bias. If Medicare for all proved successful in one or a couple states you'd probably still dislike it just like Republicans hate Obamacare even though it's basically just Romneycare in Massachusetts on a national scale.

"Post 1 of 2:Took me a little while to respond as I was fairly busy this week. These posts are long but perhaps you brought it on yourself for not seeing my past post history and realize I always respond  with lengthy debates. Oh well such is life. I don't know why I'm arguing with someone who derails government but then will almost certainly rely on Medicare Medicaid and SS when you get older. I guess I'm just a gluten for pointing out hypocrisy and beating myself up.>UPS & FedEx put the USPS to shame.[Not when it comes to individual mail](http://fitsmallbusiness.com/fedex-vs-ups-vs-usps/). And moreover USPS is basically equal to FedEx/UPS in terms of rates for heaver stuff although obviously it is situation specific.Also I could have totally listed any number of other government programs that do way better than private industry like fire response police officers clean air and water roads and bridges investment research military defense the FAA the CDC school lunch programs recreational parks public libraries the FDA the FEC building codes national disaster recovery etc. etc.>>Also this: [link to a complete leftist rag known as Mother Jones]>>Oh cool! Lets see what it states as ""efficient"" government programsOh I'm sorry I didn't realize I would be attacked for my source being a biased source with equally biased right leaning Washington Times and Washington Examiner. Also you have to actually quote bias in their analysis to actually claim the results are biased. Saying a source is biased is irrelevant if their data is accurate. Mother Jones is quoting the [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities](https://www.cbpp.org/research/romneys-charge-that-most-federal-low-income-spending-goes-for-overhead-and-bureaucrats-is?fa=view&id=3655&emailView=1) which got it's data from the Office of Management and Budget. Moreover it is only commenting on the administrative costs of running these programs not on government fraud which is a different issue of efficiency. None of your articles contradict that the government pays less overhead than the private sector and it's not even close. Also as you seem to want other sources (that are not 'biased') here you go:https://newint.org/features/2015/12/01/private-public-sectorhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/25/private-sector-superiority-mythbusterhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/290433484_Discussion_Paper_Is_the_Private_Sector_More_Efficient_A_cautionary_talehttp://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/and-winner-isthe-public-sector#sthash.ekiq6avT.dpbshttp://evonomics.com/economic-myth-private-sector-works-well-and-the-public-sector/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/the-conservative-myth-of-a-social-safety-net-built-on-charity/284552/Now on to your specific complaints.>How predictable. Is it counting the [60 Billion in Medicare and 30 billion in Medicaid fraud](https://www.gao.gov/key_issues/reducing_government-wide_improper_payments/issue_summary) in their calculations?Your first link is a doozey. GAO is not talking about 'fraud' as you put it but improper payments. In fact as they spell out in the [very useful FAQ section](https://paymentaccuracy.gov/faq/)>Are all Improper Payments fraud?>No.åÊåÊContrary to common perception not all improper payments are fraud (i.e. an intentional misuse of funds).åÊåÊIn fact the vast majority of improper payments are due to unintentional errors.åÊåÊFor example an error may occur because a program does not have documentation to support a beneficiary‰Ûªs eligibility for a benefit or an eligible beneficiary receives a payment that is too high‰ÛÓor too low‰ÛÓdue to a data entry mistake.>Also many of the overpayments are payments that may have been proper but were labeled improper due to a lack of documentation confirming payment accuracy.åÊåÊWe believe that if agencies had this documentation it would show that many of these overpayments were actually proper and the amount of improper payments actually lost by the government would be even lower than the estimated net loss discussed above.It is true that a certain amount of Medicare/Medicaid spending can be attributed to fraud. But it's actually interesting that the best way to fix that is to [hire more people to investigate fraud rather than reduce government employment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/budget-cuts-force-scale-back-of-health-care-fraud-investigations/2013/07/25/888fee8e-f536-11e2-9434-60440856fadf_story.html?wpisrc=nl_fed). Moreover it's important to note that [the private sector is just as ineffective as Medicare and Medicaid](https://www.icsi.org/_asset/y74drr/eliminatingwaste-ushelathcare2012.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwjztomVv6XWAhUWz2MKHfCmCBAQFggzMAE&usg=AFQjCNGsmsQA4rGgF22YETOPnQhoIvmPVg). As my source shows waste in the total healthcare industry is ~$900 billion for a $3.2 trillion industry per year. That's because the people who tend to cheat the insurance agencies and government out of money are the providers of healthcare not the recipients. Finally it's critical to note that the [overhead for Medicare/Medicaid is <2% whereas the private industry can range from 12-19%](http://cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/overhead-costs-for-private-health-insurance-keep-rising-even-as-costs-fall-for-other-types-of-insurance). This means that if you take into account the total estimated 'fraud' cost of about 10% on Medicare/Medicaid and add the 'waste' of overhead Medicare/Medicaid still beats the pants off most private insurance in total efficiency in terms of dollars going directly to patient care.>>SNAP>>Oh yeah no fraud other than the fact they found at least 27000 deceased people still getting assistance due to someone stealing their SS number. So I never said there was no fraud in the system. Any large scale program private or public is going to have fraud in it but the question is how much and is it worth it for the benefits of the program. Clearly SNAP is one of those programs. [With a low overpayment/underpayment rate of ~3.6% SNAP has a much lower fraud rate then say what the IRS sees which has a underreporting rate of 18% and looses hundreds of billions of dollars annually on fraudulent tax returns.](https://www.cbpp.org/food-assistance/snap-combating-fraud-and-improving-program-integrity-without-weakening-success) And the majority of SNAP fraud is an error of the providers not the dishonesty of the recipients. And as my article points out the benefits clearly outweigh these drawbacks as SNAP lifts millions of people out of poverty and extreme poverty. Finally it is a lower level of fraud than private businesses [which report 6% of fraud per year](http://www.peoriamagazines.com/ibi/2005/nov/privately-held-companies-are-frequent-fraud-victims). And [here's an article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/04/what-many-americans-get-wrong-about-food-stamps-according-to-an-economist/?utm_term=.4b32dc91e7a8) for good measure addressing the many other myths of food stamps.>>Public Housing Assistance>>At least $106 billion in fraud each year in improper paymentsAgain improper payments do not mean fraud but rather can often mean documentation error. Your own source says that fraud in this program is only $1.3 billion which is much less than [the $5 billion Goldman Sachs paid in mortage fraud fees](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/business/dealbook/goldman-to-pay-5-billion-to-settle-claims-of-faulty-mortgages.html) [Citigroup Bank's payment of $7 billion to settle mortage loan fraud](http://money.cnn.com/2014/07/14/news/companies/citi-settlement/index.html) or [Bank of America's $16.6 billion settlement of mortage fraud](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bank-america-pay-1665-billion-historic-justice-department-settlement-financial-fraud-leading). In fact 80% of mortage fraud is committed by the lender [according to the FBI](http://askmikebutler.com/fbi-reports-80-of-mortgage-fraud-committed-by-lenders/). And realistically there is much less incentive for a government employee to commit fraud than a private lender who makes money ever sale.",

Because personally I would gladly pay more in taxes and know that everyone in my community is covered than pay out to a company that doesnt provide shit,
"I do agree that Bernie was campaigning for too long after he was mathematically eliminated but that was just to make sure his agenda would be part of the Democratic Platform moving forward. He stayed away from personal attacks for the entirety of the campaign and after be finally bowed out he campaigned for Hillary just as hard if not harder than any other surrogate. So I have a hard time wrapping my head around how Bernie could have a ran a ""less divisive"" campaign. Yes there were many Bernie supporters who either voted for Trump or third party but that has more to do with how eclectic his fan base is than anything ""too damaging"" he said about Hillary. He appealed  to people that were so anti-establishment that they would even consider voting Trump people so far-left that they didn't think Bernie was radical enough and Libertarian-ish people who may not have agreed with him in everything but wouldn't  question his motives.  These are all voters who would never have voted for Hillary in the first place so to point to the way Bernie campaigned against Hillary as a reason for them not voting Democrat I would have to disagree.",
>All the top universities are based in the US. Ehr what.>Again it's expensive yes because these are leading institutions and quality standards are high.You actually have no idea how it works in Europe. Zero. Zilch. It blows my mind you're still commenting about itThe reason medical studies tuitions are so cheap in Europe is because they are subsidized by governments. Medical studies are top notch in Europe and quality of care is equal or superior to what you get overall in the US. May be one day you'll speak to an American doctor about their European counterparts and you'll realize how dumb and clueless your comment was. They know them they meet at doctors conventions every year to update their knowledge and share research.,
Alright so Medicare gets funding from a few different sources. The two big ones are the payroll tax and the general fund. The payroll tax is taken out of everyone's paycheck and sent straight to Medicare. It can't be spend on anything except for Medicare. The General Fund is what you pay into with the rest of your tax dollars. Congress uses the general fund to pay for damn near everything from debts to dinners. Right now about 35% of Medicare is paid with the payroll tax. 40% is paid from the general fund.Sanders' plan is to increase the payroll tax so that it covers effectively all of the costs so that Medicare no longer draws money from the general fund. It'd end up putting back about $200 billion annually into the general fund which can be used to pay off our debts or more likely provide aid for the people transitioning out of the health insurance industry.We're in debt because the government buys shit without raising taxes. Sanders wants to raise taxes so we can afford to buy the shit we need.,
Again what is this quality you are talking about? If we can't measure that in terms of outcomes such as life expectancy what are you basing this claim on? Moreover what does quality matter if not everyone can get access to the same level of care?Lasik and countless other (more necessary) procedures are much cheaper in other countries.Yes it does have to do with economics. The difference in life expectancy between rich and poor black and white in the US is measured in decades. That is a disgrace. It is ridiculous to say that is attributable entirely to individual lifestyle choices when survey after survey shows that even insured Americans hesitate to see doctors until they have an emergency because of cost concerns.,
It varies case by case. My wife is on medicare/medicaid  for disability and gets what you described in the latter half of your comment.What is needed is a hybrid: There needs to be a system that allows people access to basic preventative care and a safety net for catastrophic emergency care (such as brain surgery car accidents heart attack etc...) while also allowing room for people to choose better options. There's also the issue of increasing hours and cutting pay. Which sounds to me like the UK is not a good control group for this system since there is more than one variable that can affect q.o.c.,
>In the UK your doctor is assigned by your zip code you have littlen to no options the treatments are budgeted by the government.So are you saying the concern is that it will evolve to that point b/c again we aren't at this point anyway talking about having government run hospitals or physicians employed by the government. I agree that choice among providers is important. And treatments are budgeted by insurance now and when insurance comes with a job unless you want to buy an individual plan you don't have much choice either. >Routinely there's new drugs that are highly expensive but are not available in the UK and there's no option to pay out pfaense pocket.I do think you should be able to pay out of pocket for certain things if they aren't covered. >I'm not saying current us healthcare system is better.. but for me I'd rather pay out of pocket and get a good service than pay the government for a mediocre service.I get that and for those who can I have no problem with it. I guess I just feel that there are all kinds of ways this can be implemented and we don't have to follow the UK cookie cutter. We can have a basic plan everyone gets (I know Bernie wants comprehensive but you know...) with availability for above and beyond in a private market for example. ,
"> Convincing companies to convert healthcare cost savings into increased salaries and/or other compensation for workersMan I didn't even consider that. I'm sure many companies would just see it as a huge freebie and an easy way to make some cuts. Cut back on their own expenses by millions but only give a tiny percentage of their savings back to their employees for example. ""Here's your dollar raise!"".My monthly health insurance would cost $1000 a month if I had to pay it entirely out of my own pocket. Something tells me that my company isn't going to just give me a $12000 raise to my salary over night.",
As a business owner I would definitely be able to pay employees more if as a business we didn't carry the burden of providing health care. Beyond just the portion of the premiums we pay there is huge internal administrative costs. These costs consist of set up enrollment answering daily individual questions and negotiating every year for new rates. The costs outside the premiums in hours is huge. Not to mention no longer having to say your benefits got worse this year it's costing us 35% more for less benefits so we are only able to give you this raise. The average employee at a company would probably be astounded if they knew how much of their potential earnings go into our health system and the insurance administration overhead instead of into their pocket. ,
IMO the biggest problem is how the implementation would affect the economy given that healthcare is such a big part of it and this would be a massive shock to the system. As you pointed out it will affect companies and the resources they have dedicated to healthcare. It will affect insurers hospitals and all their employees (as well as medical schools nursing schools and loans taken out to pay or them just off the top of my head) the legal system (including every states' many laws regarding medical expenses) the drug industry medical supply industry etc.The shock to the system isn't a reason to not convert to single payer but it is something that will probably need a lot of planning before it can go into effect without causing a massive hit to the economy.,
It's not that hard because of two things.1. Your healthcare deduction from your check immediately reverts over to the federal tax column and likely dips.2. Competition - I'm distrustful of alot of capital competition claims. But if all these companies end up with massive slush funds of cash that was allocated to payroll eventually the Dam will break and somebody will realize how bout we just poach all the other employees by just paying more?There's actually a third minor component. Companies like Wal Mart that artificially deflate hrs worked to keep from crossing the threshold in which they'd have to start offering health insurance will slowly start raising hrs as it makes far more sense than keeping them low for other existing reasons. The few unions we do have could likely lobby for more concessions with the extra room them and management have to work with in a budget.,
I think a lot of it depends on how the company calculates the paychecks. Where I work they take the gross amount of the check and then deduct health care from that as a line item same as they do tax withholding 401(k) etc. If the insurance cost were eliminated that would just be one fewer deduction so my check would go up. If they wanted to keep that money they'd have to explicitly lower my per-hour rate (which according to the rules of the company would mean I would have to sign something). Of course any back-end expenses that they have which aren't passed on to me would be entirely opaque to me and they could do whatever they wanted with that money and I'd never know.,
About half our defense budget is payroll and facilities maintenance. The defense strategy for the past 70 years has been any war we fight is going to be on the other side of one of those moats we call the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. There will be local partners in the area from which we can stage and if we have allies in the war we will become the Arsenal of Democracy like we did in ww2. To do that the DoD had an extensive air land and sea transport arm able to take whatever we can't to wherever we want whenever we want.Other than that the US spends more on healthcare than on defense by an order of magnitude.,
"> Why don't we ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share in taxes?How do we determine what that is? ""Fair"" is loaded word that is easy to appreciate when things are symmetric but is very hard to pin down when thing are not.  Perhaps fair is everybody paying the same amount of taxes?  After all a rich individual cannot really make much more use of the roads or of medicare or of a number of other programs than a poor person.Or maybe fair is everybody paying the same percentage of their income?  That's not fair you say?  What about if we ignore the first $10k to lessen the impact of the tax on the poor?You don't like either of those systems?  You're going to have a hard time selling anything else as clearly fair unless you argue for something extreme like everybody ending up with the same after-tax income.  Don't get me wrong the fact that many rich people are able to count much of their income as ""investment income"" and pay a very low tax rate on it while most people pay a higher rate definitely seems unfair especially if you believe that people who earn more should pay a higher tax rate.  But it is intellectually offensive to hear people use terms like ""fair share"" as if they weren't empty rhetorical devices.Life is unfair.  While we can make it more fair than it is we will never reach a consensus about the most fair thing to do about it.  There are plenty of good pragmatic practical reasons to tax the rich more than we do (though not so much that it might drive them to relocate something that they can actually afford to do) and you are much better off arguing to change the tax code for those reasons than by complaining that it is unfair; even if you could convincingly argue that the tax system is unfair you wouldn't have much of a basis to improve it.",
"Our defense budget is 587 Billion.  Single payer for california alone is 400B.  Cutting defense is a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of Single payer.  I wish people would do math and realize ""Cutting Defense"" isnt going to pay for anything.  I am all for cutting the spending because we can certainly pare down un-needed spending.  But pretending thats going to solve our problems is ludicrous and is a lie fed to people like you.  We could at most cut down about 100 Billion and still maintain a proper military without effecting stock markets or major economic impact.  Good luck finding the other 2 Trillion we will need.

Why don't we push for laws saying that Congress can't vote to give themselves raises? Why don't we reform our prison system so we stop spending billions annually trying to prevent prison re-entry?We can sing the Shoulda Coulda Wouldas all day but that still wont change the reality of things. All of those are real issues but all will warrant separate uphill battles. It's important to not get so hung up on what should be and focus on the reality of how we get there. ,
I think paying that much on defense keeps a lot of your youth employed.While also resulting in funds for all sorts of other programs.Ideally I suppose you would have work available for young americans or the ability to relocate to work so recruitment wouldn't be easy. Jobs are not that easy to find and the college option at the end of it is a big plus.Of course this is a polite way of ingoring the whole military industrial complex and a lovely industry where the end products are usually meant to destroy themselves or destroy a target.In game economy terms - are Armies and munitions money sinks?,
"As a Conservative I'll probably get downvoted to hell but whatever here are my two cents.Why don't we cut our ludicrously high spending on defense?1)If we're talking simply about the amount of expenditure why don't we cut from Social Security ($888B)? That type of rhetoric will never lead anywhere. If you believe we should cut military spending what exactly should we cut from the military? Base military pay is already garbage starting at $18k as an E-1 (Private). Give me some numbers something to work with or potentially agree with you.Why don't we ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share in taxes?2)Do tell what is in your opinion a ""fair share""? The top 5% already pay 56% of all taxes even though they only hold 34% of all income.I lost interest after the first two so I'll make it quick. Third that's agreeable but it doesn't account for certain things such as sudden fluctuations in currency value such as inflation. Maybe we could potentially agree on restrictions as to how they can increase their income such as I don't know already existing restrictions such as I don't know the 27th Amendment? Maybe further changes are needed but I can't really comment too much as I'm not super well-read on this issue. Fourth I'm not very well-read on this issue so I can't debate against something I have no knowledge of.",
I'd doubt it would that cheap. Even when people have insurance through their job and it's cheap the company is paying a lot more than the employee. I doubt the taxes would be less than those two costs  combined but you'd be the one paying the whole thing. Honestly this idea is great and all but I want some real numbers before we vote something like this in. I'd be unhappy with anyone sponsoring  this after being told the costs would be in a separate bill. No thank you. I've already seen the inefficiency of our government and We've watched this whole situation unfold before. If I'm missing something someone please correct me but I'm over the bullshit theater. Either bring us something we can understand and has been worked out let's get some new leaders who can or give me my money back. ,
>>* To the idea that Medicare is more administratively efficient this is merely an accounting gimmick. What counts as overhead varies country to country and the statistic ignores the 60 billion in fraud estimate for Medicare which is about 10% of its budget. Add to that that many aspects of administrating medicare such as actually acquiring and dispersing funds are done by other arms of the government like the IRS and Congress so don't fall on Medicare's balance sheet. Further you don't have as many options in suing medicare should they violate the terms of your agreement so their legal costs are artificially low. When accounting for this Medicare's administrative costs are closer to 16-20% which are in line with industrial averages.Just to add to this the idea that administrative spending is a bad thing is a fallacy in and of itself. Some types of administrative spending actually lowers overall costs like spending on auditing and fraud detection. ,
Those are some great points to take into account.  I only question your assertion that Pharma spends more on R&D than Marketing - I agree that actual advertising $$ spent are lower than R&D but I think it's presumptuous to assume that the associated functions with making that advertising/promotion/marketing happen can be fully separated as you have proposed.  For example Pfizer spent $3.1B on advertising (including production costs) out of their total $14.8B in SI&A in 2016 compared with $7.8B in R&D.  But can you really tell me that Pfizer just sent $3.1B to marketing firms and called it a day?  Sales marketing legal and the S&H expense associated with all of that marketing (samples and such) are all a part of total marketing.  I agree some of those expenses can be separated as not being related to advertising but you can't say with 100% certainty that they aren't spending as much or more than R&D on their total marketing efforts.  Most companies include the cost of maintaining support functions for that as a part of their overall Marketing budget.,
All those countries have universal coverage they don't all have single payer (especially single payer in the form of a national health insurance). Most countries have either a very highly regulated multipayer (Germany Switzerland Japan France etc) a fully nationalized health care system (UK most of the Nordic countries) a combination of social health insurance and a nationalized system (Australia) or just social health insurance (Canada and Taiwan). Medicare for all is a social health insurance plan and as mentioned only two other countries fully rely on such a system. That's not to say that it's not possible to have a social health insurance model in the US just that it's harder to use other countries as a model because they use different systems. ,
While it's great that you're opposed to lies and fearmongering about healthcare you appear to have fallen victim to them.First single payer is one form of universal health care but it's not the only form.  Most countries with universal health care have a multipayer system with a strong government option (for example: France Germany Switzerland Belgium the Netherlands). Single payer systems are actually pretty rare.  In fact Medicare is basically a multipayer program given that the vast majority of Medicare enrollees have supplemental Medicare Advantage plans through private insurers.  Both can achieve the goals Sanders wants to achieve.Second Clinton has supported universal health care for decades.  She's also supported policies (such as the public option) that would reduce overall health care expenditures.,
> I'm curious why you didn't reply to the other commenter I'm at work and getting a lot of replies? Don't patronize me.> Republicans flounder to even repeal the ACA they've been demonizing for years.Democrats will flounder in the exact same way when and if they retake power.The bill will not be good. It has no reason to be good. It will be voted on anyway for points. We haven't seen the text but I guarantee that's the case. It's some extreme BS that doesn't give the market time to adjust with the changes and it involves a tax hike that most Americans will never agree to or else it will simply not include a plan to pay for it. Just wait. It's the Bernie Sanders way: big unworkable promises that pretend Republicans don't exist -> get popular support -> blame centrists and the establishment for not going along -> repeat.> You'll never get anything put through if you just sit and wait for it to be politically feasible to pass something.That's exactly how you get things through. That's how ACA got passed.> the more it's out there and people are talking about itThe more Republicans will call us evil commies partisan divide will deepen they will be energized they will win. This isn't a symmetrical game. Their job is to destroy. It's an easy job. Ours is to create. It's hard. We can't just make big promises and hope the voters forgive us when we can't deliver. Democratic voters are too smart for that.edit: when it comes down to it even if this does energize people and move in the right direction it's still *not exciting* if you know what's actually going on. It's snore-inducing.,
I know first and second hand how companies are forced to use their insured employees more than their part time employees. I also know what it's like to stay in a dead end job far too long because of a fear I would lose my health insurance. For a lot of service sector jobs employers try to keep their costs down by minimizing how many full time employees they have. They will make those employees salaried and require them to work more hours to compensate for a lack in hours they can give to part time employees to avoid having to consider them full time for insurance purposes.,
For now but the excise tax on health plans over a certain value (should only hit the top 15% of plans or fewer) kicks in next year.That's gonna add a 40% tax on high-value high-end health plans.And fun fact there's no inflationary adjustment tacked on. So every year more and more employer-offered plans will fall under the excise tax. Because very few businesses are large enough to keep negotiating the plans down year-over-year.But the state/fed can set limits on the plans on the exchanges so this will start to force people over from employer-offered plans to the exchange-based plans. Over time under current estimates this would put ~75% or more of plans under the excise tax by 2025 which would be well past the tipping point at which it would be uncommon to have an employer-backed plan finally decoupling employers from health plans.Why is this good? Well for one it will give people a lot more options than the 2-3 usually offered by employers so they'll likely be closer to the value they actually need. Second it'll keep employers from cutting back-end deals where execs get shiny sexy health plans that regular employees subsidize because that's bullshit. Third it'll give more negotiating power to the states via their exchange rules. And lastly it'll help keep people more sensitive to their actual cost of care as well as forcing employers to pay them their full salary not being able to hide shittier pay by pretending their health plans are better.,
"Well said. I'm in a ""job lock"" at the moment. I have an ok job that I hate. I saved hard for years and I'm currently buying a house. I'm excited about it but I'm wiping out almost all of my savings and the ability to go back to school for a long time. I can't afford to work part time or take on more loans especially not both. I want to change industries but I'm stuck doing what I'm doing and can't afford to take a pay cut.I'm betting on the fact that buying this house now will be a better investment than heading back for a degree in the long run but being able to do both would put me way ahead and be better for the economy as a whole.",
Well as I'm being downvoted I'll bite.Let's say I run a company I employ people at a reasonable hourly rate (15/hour) and offer competitive benefits.  The job is not something people want to do.  It's hard dirty with shitty hours due to the type of work it is.  The Government implements Universal Healthcare/Single Payer.  That's great right?  Not really now all my workers can freely quit since my pay and benefits aren't better than taking a small pay cut for much easier job somewhere else.So to keep my business working I can do what?  Offer more per hour?  Different benefits?  That's money out of my pocket.  Universal Healthcare helps the employee it has the added effect of hurting the employer.  Let's say I raise my wage to 20/hour and that's great!But I have to let a quarter of my force go to pay for it.  Because single payer doesn't put more cash in my hands.,
>Just one of many situations (like healthcare) where the free market fails.Sure as long as you make the intellectually dishonest presumption that healthcare is anything close to a free market.>They want to abolish the minimum wage because they think the market will determine it. Well no because people need jobs.Norway Sweden Finland Denmark all lack minimum wages.> Same with healthcare. People want it and need it so they'll pay what they have to. All that favors the business owners and insurance companies and hurts the people. Food is more inelastic than healthcare and it functions fine in a market.,
The rational actor assumption doesn‰Ûªt really ever hold except for in thought experiments. It‰Ûªs useful in those contexts but any philosophy of consumer behavior based on it is farcical. That doesn‰Ûªt mean the theory doesn‰Ûªt work. It just means that it can‰Ûªt be applied without seriously considering the conditions. The other key assumption in microeconomics that of perfect information is also necessary for thought experiments. But it is even _more_ broken than the rational actor assumption in practice. You see it fails to account for advertisement. Advertisement at a fundamental level is the subversion of these assumptions for gain sold as a means to achieve more perfect information (‰ÛÏinforming consumers‰Ûù).In reality what it does is twofold: it _conditions_ consumers into associating emotional responses with symbolic cues (jingles logos product silhouettes etc) and it _disinforms_ consumers by reducing an intractable amount of information they would need to consider to make an informed choice down to empty aesthetics. It reduces the ‰Û÷activation energy‰Ûª to make a purchase. Advertising can certainly be informative. But in practice today most advertising is not. It‰Ûªs disinformative. It offers a conveniently simple way to think about something because _actually researching the decisions you make as a consumer in the modern era is hard towards impossible_. The same is true of politics. An aesthetic is so much easier than a philosophy. Especially when you can quickly find out exactly what ‰ÛÏyour team‰Ûù would say to any common political inquiry nearly instantly. It‰Ûªs the path of least resistance. ,
You‰Ûªre reminding me of people I know who work for Heritage/Koch related think tanks and public policy groups. Almost identical talking points similarly well rehearsed and well articulated. That said while your point makes sense _superficially_ you‰Ûªre also dissembling with semantics. What exactly do you mean by bad‰Ûù decision?What it seems like you‰Ûªre trying to say is that collectivization of risk encourages individual risk taking. Yeah. No shit. Your example is also bullshit: you always bear the full consequences of your eating and health habits. Whether you have to seek healthcare to cope with them is external to that decision making process. People are not going to reason along the lines of: ‰ÛÏwell chemo is covered by my public healthcare so I‰Ûªm going to smoke a pack a day.‰Ûù That‰Ûªs frankly idiotic. Your final question is just pure rhetoric. False dichotomy and not born out by what we can observe about other countries‰Ûª healthcare outcomes. Let me ask you this: why does insurance even make sense as a model for healthcare? What about recouping overhead costs? What about the benefits of collectivization during price negotiation? If collectivized risk is so bad and encourages such bad decisions then why do people making the same points you are insist that the government subsidize risk for lenders and investors?,
Firstly you realize that the rate of increase of premiums has been increasing since long before the ACA and that the ACA **slowed** the rate of premium increases right? In the absence of the ACA they would have increased even more. Also: that is a problem that universal healthcare solves. An employer simply doesn‰Ûªt have to worry about providing health care for their employees (or paying for it). Simply _not their problem_! That also means less paperwork! Secondly if you don‰Ûªt want to pay into social security then _leave the country and become a citizen somewhere else_.If you don‰Ûªt want to live in a civilized country with a functioning government and welfare state then don‰Ûªt. Stop drinking the Koch-aid. The days where you could make yourself look smart by repeating Heritage talking points you read online are over. ‰ÛÏAmerican libertarianism‰Ûù (which is not libertarianism in general) has been exposed as a proto-corpofascist fraud. It‰Ûªs propagandized to get people to accept corporate takeover of essential state and federal services. It has never demonstrated any substantive successes.,
For routine services I wish I could call several doctor's offices and say: how much will it cost to come in for an STD screen? or allergy testing? or I have some questions about this odd pain in my arm can I get 30 min of time with a nurse to talk about it?Or if I go in for a checkup and the Dr says you have this problem and that problem and I need to do test XYZ they should be able to give you an itemized estimate like the auto shop does. Why is that not possible?Veterinarians do this why not human doctors?Even if I ask my insurance they can only give me a ballpark. I *think* they offer a nurse hotline for free though. There's a service here called Any Lab Test Now. You can go onto their web site and see all the tests they offer. You can walk in off the street give them money and they will do the tests you ask and send you the results later. It's so incredibly painless and you know exactly what the cost will be ahead of time.,
> Well the evidence is that every other developed country provides better healthcare for less money than America. So on average everyone will benefit. No that is data. Other things affect the cost of healthcare.Evidence rules out possibilities which means you must account for those other factor's impact to isolate the impact of single payer on costs itself.>In the same way we are screwing people by forcing them to contribute to social security when their retirement savings get a higher yield on the stock market. Or when they pay taxes to unemployment benefits but never find themselves unemployed. The government is forcing people to be protected from unforeseen tragedy like stock market crashes or layoffs. This has a cost but also an obvious benefit. That doesn't mean it's worthwhile and any benefit seems worth it spending other people's money.>Single payer would also protect people from unforeseen illness. It's am important part of the social safety net the America currently lacks. You say this as if it's the only way to protect people.,
"**READ IT ALL. THERE IS MUCH TO SAY.**I will repeat. She. Lost. To Trump. That is fact. And I never said a word about Bernie. First you will  listen if you want to keep the respect of those coming up behind you. What part of ""we will die younger and poorer"" is so difficult to understand?  We've watched our parents get told single payer will arrive....someday. They waited more than 25 years for it.  And someday never came.  And this go around it is OUR babies whose futures are on the line.  Are we to sacrifice them on the altar of more waiting for someday?!Right now circulating many places on the internet and even in a few newspapers Boomers are getting the moniker of ""The Worst Generation.""  The oldest Baby Boomer is 71 years old. He only has about 12 years left in him at best and there is no wishing away the grave.  A generation that refuses to recognize the heartfelt suffering of its children and grandchildren and do something about it IMMEDIATELY is one that is blind and in danger of losing any moral authority. Permanently. It won't matter what Boomers think of themselves at the end of the day because it will be Generation X and Millennials that will write the books about them. They will remember it if as a voting bloc you kept selecting politicians who took money from pharmaceuticals and from insurance companies and did nothing to help them make it all go away. For law and order to reign on legalized bribery and for single payer to be a powerful weapon against employers who mistreat their employees (they can no longer hold healthcare coverage over the heads of employees and keep them from quitting if they are mistreated with single payer.) For the poor giving them a chance to see a doctor and get medical care not based on how much they can pay but on their need and have it be as merciful as any country in Europe.  Mississippi is the poorest state in the land and has an eye popping rate of HIV. I guarantee you that HAART meds are expensive for someone who never finished high school and that is a sizeable chunk of MS's population...many of which live in govt issued trailers and can't afford a fridge to keep their meds cool AND afford the drugs that keep them from dying of AIDS.They will remember your idealism becoming dangerous in that you always wanted to believe the best of people always wanted to be the first to ignore flaws and the last to want to be called a party pooper on that account.  *It shouldn't matter if x y and z is true about MY politician he will be everything I dreamed of!!""* -Except that it was obvious to all but you that such was not the case. In the near future your children will condemn you for letting politicians use you because they know you vote based on how the politician makes you *feel.* Not by fact checking.  Your own kids will tell you even now if you actually listened to them long enough  that all it takes is to turn off the television and fire up your phone to check government statistics and the like.  Track who is at what fundraiser. Check who donated what and when. What the voting record is on paper.But if trends continue Boomers will be known as an entire generation of fools who took everything at face value because since they were kids they were conditioned to believe the man in the tv was as good as Howdy Doody.  It will be said that they just couldn't handle the simple truth that everything is wonderful right on up 'til it isn't. The bad guys win. There is no fairytale. Their angels played them by telling them what they wanted to hear got the votes and then went back to the status quo.The politicians played make believe that they‰Ûªre for the American people long enough to get elected‰ÛÓand then would get straight to work serving their donors while occasionally trying to deliver crumbs to the worker bees to convince themselves they‰Ûªre something slightly more than unethical pushovers for their puppetmasters. Boomers' angels kept emphasizing issues that were holdovers from the 1960s and played identity politics while with sleight of hand they dismantled the New Deal with the help of Republicans and abandoned the laborer to his doom. They totally ignored everything their parents said about freezing in Hooverville because in college they read books by Galbraith and did nothing to stop the Telecommunications Act Democrats removing organized labor from its structural position in the Democratic Party in the 1970s free trade deals that gutted manufacturing once and for all in the Great Lakes the destruction of Glass Steagall productivity skyrocketing since 1979 but with no increase in wages adjusted for inflation...at all. They listened and shook their pom poms as their angel politicians spoke rapturously about 401ks and Roths but the same lied by omission in that such a retirement plan only works if the stock market continues to go up.  And with no Glass Steagall there was nothing to stop very wealthy men from using Wall Street as a casino.  Even when the market crashed in 2008 and their angels did nothing to punish the bankers who crashed the global economy OR help recover their pensions they shook their pom poms.**THIS IS THE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE YOUNG. WATCHING THEIR ELDERS MAKE FOOLS OF THEMSELVES.  WATCHING THEM TALK WITH BOASTFUL TONES OVER THE SIT INS AND MARCHES BUT SITTING ON THEIR ASSES WHEN THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS ARE THE ONES GETTING ARRESTED TODAY. WATCHING THEM VOTE FOR POLITICIANS WHO ARE ON RECORD AS VOTING AGAINST THEIR INTERESTS AND DOING IT FROM 1979-2016.  OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WATCHING THEM COWER IN A CORNER RATHER THAN FIGHT BACK TO STOP AMERICA BEING THE RICHEST NATION IN THE WORLD BUT HAVING THE WORST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OF THE TOP SEVEN RICHEST NATIONS. WATCHING THEM MAKE SURE THAT THEIR HOUSE RETAINS ITS VALUE BUT KEEPS ANY YOUNGER BUYERS OUT OF THE MARKET AND IN THE WORST CASES TREATING OLD AGE LIKE A SECOND ADOLESCENCE.

Which is more important your kid's belief in you to do the right thing or your need to believe in the impossible dream that has harmed them badly?!!  They have been waiting for years.  Single payer healthcare is the first step that has to be taken to save this country from itself and reverse decades of damage.  Swallow your pride or die as the Worst Generation.

"That is a pretty bad conclusion to come to based purely on primary results. Polling showed that a lot of her support was based on ""I like Bernie's positions better but Hillary has a better chance of winning."" It was conventional wisdom that she was inevitable and that he wouldn't be able to win the general (despite him polling above her in the general against all candidates). Then she lost. Sure you can base the sample in the Democratic primary and apply that nationwide and take that as ""well she beat him in the primary and she lost the general so he would've definitely lost general"" but I think that ignores the appeal he had to voters outside the Democratic primary that she lacked; he very well could've appealed to more voters than her in the general.",
"You need to stop telling people ""what they remember"". It smarmy and annoying. My point is a strong argument is strong whether someone is able to access it or not. A *person* can err and make mistakes. A person can speak out and lose credibility. But an ideology doesn't change. Our perception of it does. My point is that universal healthcare was every bit as credible and idea when it failed as it will be when it eventually passes. The validity of the idea never changed. Clinton chose to do things and take positions people didn't like. Her popularity changing due to what she did or didn't do isn't the same as an unchanging idea. ",
There are big differences between the democratic party people who tend to vote democratic and the democratic party establishment. That's a problem but that is a problem that is fixable. It's not the problem you described. The problem you described is the party being bought out by corporate interests. I think that goes way too far. Are democrats influenced by corporate interests? I would say yes. But they still on whole balance people's interests with business interests and often put the people's interests first. Calling them neoliberals is just wrong. Or can you show me people from the democratic establishment which we both agree is to the right of the progressive movement who espouse neoliberal policies? Last I checked it was republicans who push the policies of privatization austerity deregulation free trade etc. And if you are trying to turn this into a team game which is a horrible idea you should at least understand what the teams are. ,
"I feel like you've perfectly illustrated why it's so important to get some momentum behind this conversation utilizing accessible language to push it more into the mainstream: the majority supports ""Medicare for All"" almost certainly due to high support for classic Medicare itself -- which in many respects could be characterized as ""[an extension] of government control over healthcare [relative to a totally privatized system]"". If support for a policy drops off when a pretty basic reality of it is pointed out so long as it comes packaged in the utterance of a scary phrase like ""government control"" then that means the person being polled is not entirely firm in their convictions on such a program; *reflection and conversation is therefore in need* and the only way that can possibly happen in the U.S. is to cast some light towards the issue on the national stage -- which is exactly what Sanders et al are doing.

I'll get back to you on that immigration thingy maybe i can find something.I would say go through the next few years without the insurance plan youre young and healthy i assume chances of you being ill someday are slim.Pay your bills and keep the work going eventually you'll have a big break and the dough will roll in.After that get healthcare. Dont give up the dream. I wanted to be a politician since i was 16 Im now a member of the city council im not important but i do get to work with the mayor from time to time and i will run for a spot in the house of representatives In a few years time.Point being americans that want to leave the US over its current situation is exactly what conservatives want thats one less liberal moderate or progressive vote against them.Imagine you are on the other side your fellow americans want to leave sure that gives you an edge in votes but those are still your countrymen that have lost faith in their country.Build it back up.Cheers.,
You'd be surprised how little more most Europeans are actually taxed especially in context with how insanely high the quality of life is comparatively. When I was in the US everyone is consistently worried about getting sick having an accident affording school affording good food living safely and declining infrastructure. When I moved to Europe almost all of these problems are so uncommon they weren't even understood when I tried to talk about them. Not to be that guy but the main problem is how the US government mishandles funds. The problem isn't with what we get for or taxes or what special rights you have (like guns) but with how the American government is pilfering the public.  ,

"So on some level this may be good for you as an individual. You may have a good job with good insurance you may make enough money that those public services are something you can pay for. That will never be the case for every person. There will always be people that cannot afford the healthcare they need people that legitimately need welfare for a time period etc. In our system the basic response is ""tough shit I'm not paying for it"". But what that translates into is a person that is unable to reach thier full potential because of a treatable condition that prevents them from working. I personally believe that if we are able (which we are) we have a moral responsibility to help people in need.If that argument doesn't appeal to you consider this; single payer healthcare will improve economic equality. Wealth will be redistributed more evenly among all classes rather than controlled and kept out of the economy. The top 1% has vast wealth that does not move through the economy it is hoarded. This keeps people in poverty through no fault of thier own. Single payer isn't the only solution to this problem but its something.And I don't think this is something that should be instituted over night. I think there is a great debate about the best ways to implement and what the consequences would be. These are things we should talk about there will be unforeseen problems. But the long  term goal should make that all worth it.",
That's like saying there's no point in voting Liberal Democrat in my constituency (in the UK) just because Labour was always going to win (it's an old pit village Labour *always* win). I voted Labour this year because I could get behind their message (though I considered Lib Dem because of their earmarked for healthcare income tax rise) but I voted Liberal Democrat in 2010 because at the time *their* message was the one I could get behind. I knew Labour would win but I wanted to express my support for the Lib Dem's message regardless. Knowing that your choice will not win is *never* a good reason to abstain from having your voice heard.,
"Agree to disagree. She isn't endorsing authoritarianism by saying that she's warning against buying so deeply into propaganda that you decry facts as meaningless. A statement fairly easy to extrapolate out within the given political climate.You could certainly construe it either way but I think that the way I take it is one that is obviously rooted in the context of her losing the Presidency and the sort of rhetoric that happened/is happening since. Hence her talking about trusting experts and the press. The ""press"" and ""experts"" weren't the authoritarian presence in 1984. To pretend they were is to *willfully* misread her statement. State created propaganda took the place of ""expertise"" and ""media"" within the context of the novel. That's like saying that Animal Farm is arguing politics is bad. I guess I could see how you arrived there but it's straining the source material to make such a broad claim out of it. 1984 isn't saying *any* voice of authority is inherently bad which is what people in that thread are somehow trying to say while finding an avenue of attacking Clinton.

">Importantly if any part fails the entire thing fails.Not sure what this means. Are you saying that if you don't get funding from one source you won't be able to get it from another source?>It also assumes it will be significantly cheaper than the current healthcare system and that's not necessarily trueBeing able to negotiate with healthcare providers and supply manufacturers will reduce costs. Encouraging people to go in and take care of problems early before they become larger problems will reduce costs. There are a lot of places you can save with single payer.>It's also not just ""some taxes for the rich."" It is though. The *vast* majority of the proposed funding for the plan comes from income-based healthcare premiums which affect everyone not just the rich. The parts that exclusively target the rich only make up only make up ~17% of the funding.Of course this plan is DOA right now though. It's a campaign tool not something they think is going to pass right now. It's the Democrat's vision for healthcare taking advantage of the absolute embarrassment of a flop for Republicans when they basically had no plan after campaigning against the ACA for 7 years.",
>His biggest line item except his payroll tax is speculative. $310000000000/annum is $1000 per person in the country per year.That's fair it's really a question of what you think companies would do with the extra money they have from not paying large healthcare premiums. Would they invest it in hiring more people? Would they keep the compensation packages the same value and just pay people more? Would they keep it as profit and thus pay taxes on that?I don't think it's unfair to think that we would end up getting taxes back along the line as they invest that money in a different way in their company. I agree that the exact number would be very hard to pin down beforehand.> That's a 10% tax hike on what you're paying to the government now if you make under 70k/yr.The way you sell this is that instead of paying healthcare premiums deductibles and co-pays to corporations you're paying into a large pool the government manages. A good portion of households would end up saving money.At the end of the day this works in other countries. It's not an untested idea like UBI. How we adapt it to our country to create a system that works for us is a healthy debate to have but our current system even though it was improved a lot by the ACA still isn't working for people.,
> the internal corruption in the DNC treating Bernie very unfairly and pretty much guaranteeing her nomination.Can you provide any evidence of this kind of collusion? I mean it's one thing that you would prefer Democrats when you are an organization committed to electing Democrats but it's another thing to say that you can actually manipulate voters in favor of one over the other in a primary race.In 2008 Obama did what a lot of people thought Sanders would do but Obama is in was a far greater politician than Sanders and that's why he beat Clinton 2008. So too Clinton was a far better candidate for the Democratic voters in a Democratic Party primary than was Sanders. That's why he lost overwhelmingly by many millions of votes. Nothing to do with grapes here and there from a small number of DNC staffers after Sanders was mathematically eliminated from the primaries.,
"Clinton doesn't have a brand but she definitely has a reputation because she sticks her neck out and actually works to get her policy proposals put into effect. This can't be said for Bernie Sanders who definitely was **not an unknown** before he ran for president. Certainly he may have been an ""unknown"" to a bunch of political neophytes and election tourists and ""Occupy Wall Street"" burnouts who only just woke up to ""politics"" in 2015 when they heard things like ""fuck *the system* maaaan!"" ""free college"" and ""legal weed.""But Sanders has had a long reputation of being a polemic and rabble-rouser who did a lot of nothing legislatively and irritated a lot of his liberal colleagues in Congress. Just look what Barney Frank had to say about him back almost 25 years ago. >""Bernie alienates his natural allies. [...] ""His holier-than-thou attitude ‰ÛÓ saying in a very loud voice he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else ‰ÛÓ really undercuts his effectiveness.""And Frank definitely is not a liberal lightweight. More: www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/06/the-case-against-bernie-sanders-according-to-barney-frank/ This was in 1991. It rings exactly the same today especially given how he's taken no real political risks and is only legislative successes include renaming to post offices in 40 years.",
I don't agree with him on the slavery portion.  Nobody is forcing him or his janitors to work there. He can quit if he doesn't like the Medicare reimbursement as nobody is compelling him to continue to practice. That being said I don't like the concept. But it isn't slavery. These people went to school for almost a decade and spent time grueling through residency and incredible stress and hard work and study. Then they get that good paying job and then what? You tell them that the government decided you're going to accept this paltry amount of services or quit?Though in Canada the average family doctor makes $260000 a year. That's nothing to sneeze at. I think there are tons of potential problems and costs but I don't buy the slavery angle. ,
"> People also don't understand that NOTHING is ""free"".You are correct. But the cost to not socializing healthcare is greater than the cost of socializing it.Right now there is a huge amount of people unable to work for medical reasons. The people can't be taxed. There are a huge amount of mental health issues going undiagnosed. These people are earning less and therefor being taxed less. The huge waste of administrative overhead is reducing money that could go to innovators or practitioners.Every aspect of healthcare has some tradeoff like this and there are real costs to not having a public healthcare option.",
Thanks for your views. I totally agree. I think that single payer is eventually viable but for now it's trying to solve the problem from the consequence side first. Despite my views on most things I think when it comes to matters of health especially when it comes to food policy personal responsibility and accountability and free market economics will just make the issue worse.  Everything we eat has been engineered to sell more or cost less. The consequence of course is food becoming increasingly unhealthy and addictive. We have to change this stuff first. The only way I know how to reverse obesity and diabetes is through essentially prolonged starvation or through a stomach staple procedure that essentially forces you to starve yourself (and has nasty complications both acutely and chronically). We have to fix our wrecked environment the xenoestrogens and carcinogens. We have to even do counterintuitive things like allowing teens to go to school later in the morning and promoting breastfeeding in newborns (once we get xenoestrogens out of the environment). We need to have new mothers and fathers get adequate time off to strengthen the bonds all mammals need to promote a low cortisol environment.  These far cheaper measures would pay massive health dividends. Right now we just keep playing this game while ignoring the multiple elephants in the room. ,

I'd love to see your examples of some failing nations in Europe who aren't the US and aren't a world super power. You know why these nations can afford national healthcare?

It's pretty easy to say ""I'd pay more"" when you pay nothing already like 50% of this country who don't pay a dime in federal taxes.",
That's understandable and completely correct. For a lot of regions Obamacare failed to offer good choices.That's why I'd support a single payer public option that Americans can buy into. But if it's not optional then you've taken a problem with Obamacare (that some areas only have one choice for insurance) and made it worse by stretching that out to the entire country and ensuring everyone now only has one choice.>The interesting thing about what you said is that with a Medicare for all style system it would be far more stable and less likely to be dismantled as easily. So another Trump-esque ruler couldn't destroy it quite as simply.That's not exactly true. Just depends on how big of a dick the government wants to be. It would be much harder to dismantle thousands of private insurance companies than a single government provider.,
God I hate that phrase. I know what you mean and this is by no means an attack on you  but THE PEOPLE are the government. Its not the government giving us anything  its us giving it to ourselves. The money they get comes from us  it should benefit us.  And I mean that as all of us  rich and poor alike. Yes  we should provide food  healthcare  education  peace  prosperity to everyone in this country. And really  anyone who says its not realistic is not looking for a solution and just being defeatist or listening to fox news. Every tragedy we've over come  every struggle or problem we have fixed. We shoot for the moon.... But half the country HAS to live in poverty if the other half want to live a happy life?  No. That's wrong. And its high time someone sacked up and did something about it. ,
What you're talking about is the amount you pay per pay period for your insurance premium but many employers also cover a portion of the total premium the insurance company charges for each employee's policy as a benefit to the employee. You're correct that your insurance premium would no longer be deducted from your paycheck (as a line item - your taxes would increase with a single payer system) but the employer would also no longer be responsible for their portion of the premium nor the overhead costs to administer these benefits to their employees. That money is technically money spent on those employees that the company may or may not decide to reinvest in the employees' paychecks after such a change in policy. ,
"> The question is less ""what can we do?"" and much more ""How do we convince a country of politically illiterate people to think long term for once?"" Absolutely. Anyone who DOES understand this stuff realizes this is the direction we should be going. I think a larger problem lies with our elected officials. We need to elect people into office who will be willing to raise taxes on themselves. It's not a bunch of poor people in washington. it's a bunch of rich people who strike down bills that fairly redistribute wealth. Hopefully Trump's pathetic attempt at a presidency has shined enough light on the republican party that we won't vote in more of the same next go around. ",
"I agree everyone needs defense.  But what are we defending?  When's the last time we've defended ourselves?  The navy continuing to defend sea trade routes is cool.  That's good defense spending.  But how much goes into these constant wars over some new enemy in the middle east?  There's always someone that we absolutely *have* to wipe out so obviously we can't bring the troops home.I agree that healthcare costs are too high.  But we don't need so much money going into things like drone programs that mostly kill innocent people or constantly sinking more money into things like F-35s.  We put an *obscene* amount of money into ""defense"" spending.  It most certainly is a problem.",
"Well a good start would be looking at all the loopholes the wealthiest use now to evade taxes with impunity that the rest of us cannot use.  That's a good start for tackling what's ""fair.""  Perhaps for now let's just talk about the low hanging fruit and later we can start talking about ratios curves incentives rates etc. The problem today is the free ride the wealthiest get just for being rich.  They may be admired by many who directly benefit from opportunities the wealthy can provide here and there but they should not be admired by our government especially if the lofty yet modest end goal is equal opportunity. It's perfectly fine to be wealthy but what you take out of the economy should be scaled to what you put back in via taxes.",
"-Put a cap on executive pay to 20 times their lowest paid employee.

"The actual numbers are that Medicare-for-all would cost about $1.5 trillion and we currently pay about $2.5 trillion in insurance premiums. If we completely eliminated private medical insurance and made Medicare the only plan (which is what ""single payer"" means) it would be a net savings of $1 trillion. The average household currently pays about $1500/month in premiums (including employer contributions) and would instead pay about $875/month in taxes.Other than on-average net savings the other big benefit is that taxes can be structured so you only pay them when you can afford them. Premiums can't - even if you're broke you're still expected to pay premiums.",
There's also about 15% savings in overhead that would go directly towards insurance instead of administration not to mention the reductions in administrative costs at hospitals and clinics.My mother is an RN and that's all she did the last decade of her career was getting insurance companies to pay. She didn't see patients or do any procedures. Literally she spend all day trying to finagle a way to code the claims right to get them approved. That was her entire job.It's all a big wasteful shell game to these private insurance companies.I'd estimate conservatively you'd see about an equal reduction in cost on the healthcare provider side as well.  The two combined could reach over half of the extra inflated costs we pay for healthcare in the us.You add in the ability to negotiate drug prices and I bet you get some substantial downward pressure on healthcare coverage.,
Whoa those numbers do not add up. He's talking about *massively* expanding coverage both in services offered and total number of people covered eliminating all out of pocket costs and spending $600 bn/yr less than we currently spend per year on healthcare. That is... optimistic.  Edit: To add to this he's getting the $600bn/yr savings from reduced pharma costs ($133bn) and reduced administrative costs ($500bn) but there doesn't seem to be any accounting for the additional spending that comes from expanding coverage and eliminating OOP costs.  Edit2: and that $450 number is based on a family of four living on $50k a year. That's an adjusted gross income of ~$11k. Roughly 20% of tax returns have an AGI of $12k or less so 80% of households would pay *more* than $450. That's more than a little misleading. ,
I'm really sick of people acting like corporations are holding the US hostage because there will be some mass corporate exodus if we dare to tax them. That's a libertarian revenge fantasy that we can really do without.Now while I absolutely agree we should be taxing the rich more the implication that they dodge taxes less than corporations do is kinda bonkers. I also agree that the money for this is probably going to have to come from more than one source. I'm simply suggesting that it's not that hard to say that the expected cost-per-employee to provide ACA mandated insurance is X so we'll tax you .8*X per employee instead and you no longer have to provide that insurance is a good deal to employers. It's a damn good place to start and helps alleviate the very real problem of employers not passing these savings on to their employees.,
>For example Pfizer spent $3.1B on advertising (including production costs) out of their total $14.8B in SI&A in 2016 compared with $7.8B in R&D. But can you really tell me that Pfizer just sent $3.1B to marketing firms and called it a day? Sales marketing legal and the S&H expense associated with all of that marketing (samples and such) are all a part of total marketing. Same could be said of R&D though especially legal.>I agree some of those expenses can be separated as not being related to advertising but you can't say with 100% certainty that they aren't spending as much or more than R&D on their total marketing efforts.True but you can't say they are with 100% certainty either.,
"> Everyone is saying this a single step in a long long battle ahead of us that is going to take years if not decades or longer and there are many issues in the way that need to be dealt with before this can become a thing.But why? If Sanders has a good plan why not vote it up now on party lines even if it can't get a majority or even if once we do have a majority Trump vetos it? At least we'll be putting a marker down that says the next time we have the Presidency we'll pass and sign this.The reason that's not going to happen is because this Sanders plan is not a plan. It's just a legislative equivalent of Sanders tweeting ""Healthcare is cool and everyone should have it as a right"" without explaining how that will be paid for in a manner that passes the scrutiny of CBO the media independent economists etc. In other words just like his plan during the primary. Holding a feel good vote about Medicare puts us 0% closer to actually passing universal healthcare coverage. That's because Americans don't object to people having healthcare they object to how it's going to be paid for and how much control government will have. Until we have a plan that actually answers these questions in a serious way instead of this cynical cajoling ""You like Medicare right? Well this is more of that we promise!"" (ignore that it can't be funded without tax increases on the middle class that Medicare doesn't cover dental/vision but Sanders says Medicare For All will etc) we don't actually HAVE anything.",
"> Everyone including Sanders has said this version of the bill will not pass as-is.Sort of like the GOP voting on the ACA repeal as the minority party.>Sanders is trying to avoid the GOP's folly of ""repeal and replace"" without a plan by trying to get the Dems behind a plan ahead of the 2018 elections.Not really though I don't think that's the plan.  I think his plan is to hold the Dems feet to the fire on progressive policies which seems to be working.>That is a significant difference between the GOP's past plan ""repeal and replace later"".Substantively I don't see how it is.  The GOP touted ACA repeal in vague terms and the Dems are doing that now with Medicare for all.  If you have no funding mechanism no details about how it rolls out no details about compensation for medical services then its more of a statement of values than an actual bill.",
>That said while your point makes sense superficially you‰Ûªre also dissembling with semantics. What exactly do you mean by bad‰Ûù decision?In terms of health smoking is a bad decision.

False dichotomy and not born out by what we can observe about other countries‰Ûª healthcare outcomes. I didn't say it was a dichotomy. >Let me ask you this: why does insurance even make sense as a model for healthcare?*Actual* insurance isn't collectivizing risk. It *amortizes* **individual risk** over time. Making actuarial metrics disallowed (or metrics for which there is insufficient data) from the calculation forces insurance companies to treat everyone as equally risky along that dimension which then collectivizes it.So basically the government makes insurance less like insurance and more like a collective pool thus incentivizing individual risk.The government inherently socializes losses which is normally seen as bad and maybe it's incompetence of policy makers or maybe they don't like the competition.,
That is absolutely not true with the prices. Anytime the government intervenes in anything the prices will go up and quality will go down. Citizens premiums have gone up deductibles have gone up quality is going down and soon there will be rationing. The rationing is already [happening in GB](http://www.dailywire.com/news/19204/health-rationing-england-obese-and-smokers-banned-hank-berrien#exit-modal).And you seem to agree then that what you are doing is immoral.

"Who said anything about destroying progress? We have the ACA. It's time to start making corrections to the ship and eventually using a better ship altogether. It's quite clear that this legislation is putting feelers out there into the population. No one expects this getting anywhere near passing with the current congress. However the winds of change are blowing. People smell blood in the water. Congress has been so stagnant approvals are so low and people are getting pissed. The alt-right developed. It's a matter of time before the left has more infighting (albeit less divisive in my opinion).Secondly if it has to be called ""Medicare for All"" to make people more comfortable with it so be it. We have enough dumb misleading names in legislation that at this point I don't care if it's called Generic Health Policy #1. Unlike the current majority I have much more faith in the future Dems/Independents to actually put forward a substantive policy. They've done it with the ACA and they will do it again.",
"Couple things to unpack here...1) We are quite literally not talking about Hillary. At all. You said people didn't know about Bernie. I asked why not. People's name recognition of Hillary is not relevant. Bernie ran for President. Bernie was in politics for decades before he ran for President. By your own admission people did not know him very well. How is this other people's fault?2) Diminishing HRC's career to ""married to the President"" is a little much. If Barbara or Laura Bush ran for President they may have name recognition but it would still be a bit of a confusing moment. Let's disregard all of her accomplishments as my guess is you probably would. But AFTER she was First Lady she was a Senator ran for President before (as many people often have to do before they get the nomination) and served in a Cabinet. She built that not her husband. Bernie waited until probably his last chance to run for President and never built the relationships necessary for such an undertaking. He probably never planned to run for President until recently before his run as evidenced by these actions. That is fine but that was his choice. If primary voters didn't know much about him during the primary this is his and his campaign's fault no one else's",
useless incrementalism has expanded coverage to tens of millions of people and help slow the spiraling health care costs over the past 3 decades. Single payer isn't even a cure all it's just the start of what will have to be comphrensive reform to fix systemic problems that drive up costs in our healthcare system. If we sell it as a magic bullet that will fix everything and it doesn't work we will do *far* more damage than any incremental approach ever will. As for ideas a serious look at multipayer models like Switzerland Germany and Japan work would be an excellent start. And seriously I don't mean to sound condescending but if you think that single payer is a one and done kind of battle you genuinely do not understand how complex healthcare funding and delivery is. We're talking about policy that directly affects a sixth of the US economy. Single payer multipayer it doesn't matter there will be hundreds upon hundreds of battles. ,

"> ""Why should I care""Because it costs billions if not trillions more money from the American taxpayer all to create a worse quality healthcare system. That makes *zero sense.*In what other comparison would that be acceptable?If you gave hundreds of millions of dollars to education should its quality of textbooks technology teachers and programs go up or down?If you gave hundreds of millions of dollars to a construction project should its quality of materials machinery safety equipment and end value go up or down?If you gave hundreds of millions of dollars to a seafood restaurant should they serve fresh caught crab from this morning or imitation krab that's been sitting in the fridge for months?If you gave more resources to any institution or system should that make it better or worse off?It is appalling that you have to ask why you should care about outdated broken inaccurate equipment and wait times **when dealing with diagnoses and medical treatment**.Outdated equipment means less of a chance to detect something abnormal or catch it before it becomes life-threatening. Outdated equipment means using drugs that have more major side effects and less efficiency to do what they're intended to do. Longer wait times means waiting weeks after having a bacterial infection to the point that it can cause permanent damage heart complications or sepsis. Longer wait times means feeling a bump or having signs of cancer but not being able to see an oncologist for 6 months and then not being able to schedule an MRI until several months after that. What difference does ""free universal healthcare"" mean when you are in your grave because you couldn't have treatment when you needed it. Funerals are more expensive than an average ER visit.When I had an unexpected lump in my breast I got into the doctor in two days and had an ultrasound on state of the art equipment and got it reviewed by a radiologist the next day. Turned out it was benign. Not a single person in Canada or the U.K. can say the same. The goal should be to lessen the cost of healthcare for all Americans while simultaneously increasing its innovation and quality for all. It's truly mind numbing that someone would argue the opposite that Americans should pay significantly more to have a system that is worse quality for all. ",
>unfortunately we don't get the luxury of choosing where our tax money goesAmen to that.> It just seems strange to me that people don't support something they can directly benefit from.Well there's your answer. I wouldn't directly benefit from it. I'll be stuck high and dry paying 4x what I am now and receiving half the coverage just like I'm stuck now doing the *exact same thing* because of the ACA.The Democrats promised it would be better for everyone when they shoved the ACA up our asses and all we got was fucked. Nothing got better.I'm not going to expect anything different this time.,
"People who take advantage of things frustrate me as well. I think it's important to remember though that most people share your opinion. And while I can understand the apprehension with respect to something like UBI with universal healthcare I don't see it being abused if it's properly implemented. We establish a system that allows everyone to achieve a baseline of decent health that doesn't cost anything more than what everyone pays in taxes. Anything ""discretionary"" could cost extra but the whole thing is that if the government oversees it and is paying for it it's in the government's best interest to push cost down. I think it would be a beautiful world if everyone just got out and hustled and made their money and did all the right things. The simple fact of it is that not everyone is going to do that and it's more convenient for the rest of us if they are taking as little of our tax money as possible and if that means giving them the means to live out what the rest of us would call a substandard life then it's on them if they don't want to go any higher. That is preferable to crime and disease with no way to deal with it when the problem becomes too big. ",
"My point is that the list linked above is pretty meaningless. I can be all for universal healthcare but either 1) have no opinion on the bill because there isn't enough info or 2) against the bill because it's not practical.Most of the Dems highlighted as 'No' on that list (funny because the bill was just put out and many haven't given an official opinion yet) agree with the general sentiment of the bill but that doesn't mean anything on its own.Is disingenuous to call out people like that image does. It's sort of like saying ""Oh you're against the Patriot Act? It says Patriot in the name and it's about protecting our country so you must hate America"" ignoring the fact that the bill involves more.",
For the benefit of people reading along here's the full excerpt we're commenting on:> Attempting to define reality is a core feature of authoritarianism.  This is what the Soviets did when they erased political dissidents from historical photos.  This is what happens in George Orwell's classic novel *Ninteen Eighty-Four* when a torturer holds up four fingers and delivers electric shocks until his prisoner sees five fingers as ordered.  The goal is the make you question logic and reason and to sow mistrust toward exactly the people we need to rely on: our leaders the press the experts who seek to guide public policy based on evidence ourselves.*(Transcribed from a photo of the text; any typos are my fault not Clinton's.)*Now I read that as Clinton misinterpreting the meaning of that section of *1984.*  She seems to be saying that the torture is meant to inspire distrust of experts when it's actually meant to break down individual will and resistance to authority.> She isn't endorsing authoritarianism by saying that she's warning against buying so deeply into propaganda that you decry facts as meaningless.Actually that's a pretty reasonable interpretation but certainly not what I got out of it at first read.  If two reasonable and essentially opposite interpretations of a few sentences can be inferred then it's probably a pretty poorly-worded few sentences but I'll leave my criticism of it at that.> 1984 isn't saying any voice of authority is inherently badRight it's saying that *unquestioned* authority is bad; we probably agree on that.,
The short answer is; a lot.The slightly longer answer is; seriously. Almost everything.We have a private highly profit driven multiple industry spanning healthcare complex that depends on sales driven revenue and secrecy.Imagine a retail industry that could withhold prices until you had already swiped your credit card sold a product you were going to have no choice but to buy eventually and was a publicly traded company.  There are a lot of problems causing American healthcare costs to be so high.  A lot of it has to do with several independent industries inside healthcare that are profit driven and publicly traded. Think medical equipment research and pharma. Then you have privately owned hospitals that are also profit driven but are hamstrung by insurance companies who won't pay what the hospital thinks it needs to charge to earn a profit.  So they come up with a lot of sneaky ways to generate revenue.  So of these things drive the cost up.,
"It's funding sources are pretty wide and he's assuming that it will be cheaper than it might end up being so if he doesn't get every source of funding he's looking for here or if he's wrong about the cost the entire plan will be dangerously under funded.As a campaign tool fine. I'm not impressed with it but you're right it's better than the Republicans plan.The negotiation thing.  Ok so until recently I worked in healthcare the expectation night far exceed reality here.  Medicare already negotiates shockingly low rates and my insurance provider only paid what Medicare paid.  It was among the lowest in the country and was a constant source of pain for healthcare providers.  Several threatened to stop accepting our insurance over the reimbursement rates but thought better of it when they realized patient population was a thing.  It's not the providers you need to negotiate with. There are a lot and I mean a metric fuckload of factors driving up healthcare costs.  And they each need to be addressed.  Cost of education lack of professionals profit driven care profit driven pharma and equipment which is an entire industry in and of itself and speaking of entire industries profit driven insurance the list goes on.  **There is no simple solution to these problems**.  And any solution will by it's nature kill thousands of jobs. Health insurance alone employs millions of people. It's could be as much as 6% of the economy.  A 6% reduction in the economy is also called ""recession."" There are real problems here and they need to be addressed.  As a campaign tool you have millions of people who's job kind of depends on it failing. And these are low income people. And not to put too fine a point on it but 2016 was in part decided by a few thousand people who were worried about their jobs.",
"- [Veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile finally admitted that she used her former position as a CNN commentator to relay questions ahead of debates to Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary.](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/donna-brazile-finally-admits-she-shared-debate-questions-with-clinton-campaign/article/2617742)- [It was revealed through WikiLeaks that the DNC was conspiring against Sanders potentially planning on attacking him based on his religion (or lack thereof) or planning to undermine him claiming that he was incompetent.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wikileaks-dnc-bernie-sanders_us_579381fbe4b02d5d5ed1d157)- [Clinton also commanded a lead from the start among the Party's superdelegates.](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-sanders-democrats-20160516-snap-story.html)- [The debate schedule was created deliberately to prevent as many people as possible from seeing them before their time to vote and despite the fact that ""other campaigns have advocated (not surprisingly) for more debates and for the schedule to start significantly earlier.""](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5688#efmASYAcT)The DNC had had their winner picked from the start. All they wanted to do was put on an act of democracy.",
How about when Brazile passed debate questions to the Hill camp and did it multiple times.She denied it for months but after immense public pressure buckled and apologized for it and said it was wrong.http://www.salon.com/2017/03/20/finally-donna-brazile-apologizes-for-passing-debate-questions-during-clinton-sanders-primary-battles/And if the future Interim DNC chair did that who knows what else top DNC officials had done to tip the scales.Or what else Brazile did that went under the radar. Not to mention that HRC didnt come out and denounce it as soon as the debate questions went to her.I also suggest you read the internal email exchanges on the DNC on how they planned to sabotage Bernie's campaign. Or how they limited polling places in heavy Bernie areas.And thats just the tip of the iceberg.Or how about the fact that HRC with her name recognition brand and last name went up against an unknown jew from vermont and it took all the political capital she had and external help to bury him.Imagine if she had none of that?She would have been smashed.Stop bringing this crap up again its over for HRC. Shes the past Bernie is the future.Hes making that known right now with this bill.,
If you read any of the leaked DNC emails you would know there was a lot more wrong with what they were doing than that. There was a lot that went wrong and all of that was a big reason why Debbie Wasserman Schultz had to step down after the leaked emails came out.Also the DNC was working to make Clinton their candidate before any midterm elections ever happened. That's a big problem. The party isn't a single candidate and if someone wants to run in that party they should be able to have the opportunity to do so without being sabotaged against.,
"I am in no mood to take up 20 minutes of my time to debunk you. So this is the only comment im making.Im done talking about HRC on this sub and the amount of her apologists on this sub is disturbing during the election she was hated here. And rightfully so.Yes Clinton has a brand its her name which she owes thanks to her husband.She sticks her neck out when convenient and flip flops more than a fish out of water.There is no such thing as ""free stuff mannn"" its paid for via taxes the taxes are just allocated in a better way.Education and healthcare for all would cost more in taxes but that cost would be offset by having no more premiume and no more deductibles.Not to mention the thousands saved in student fees. You know this dont be obtuse.And yes sure i can believe that quote. I give you that but hes making headway now But thats just 1 example i can point out dozens about Clinton.",
And I would argue that no-one knows another person's need and ability better then that person themselves. So setting up a beurocracy to determine who needs what and who has what ability will only lead to people who need not getting what they need and those with some ability not using it so they won't get targeted for extra work to cover those who may or may not have greater needs than their own. Not only that but lobbying will become even worse and the wealth divide will widen as those with the power become those with the greatest need.Talk about a race to the bottom.,
You are abusing statistics to make a false point. Canadians don't wait any longer than Americans for serious issues and not much longer than American's in urban areas for anything non elective. Canada has a larger percentage of their population spread out in rural areas so yes it takes longer to see a doctor when you live 150 miles from the nearest thing that can qualify as a city. Your previous statement that thousands of Canadians cross the boarder to get treatment is also bullshit. They did a study. http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/3/19.full That's a myth propagated by the right.And if you don't like Canada's system then we don't have to model ours after theirs. There are dozens of other countries with systems better than ours. People who are against single payer always point to Canada for some reason like it's the only example of universial healthcare.,
"It's not ""making sure nobody confronts the bad"". It's being honest about the very obvious fact that the downsides of typical universal healthcare system are minuscule compared to the downsides of the American healthcare system. Making a huge improvement is worth it even if there are some bad aspects to it. Anyways the USA will almost definitely have universal healthcare within 10 years. So you can continue to say you talking points against universal healthcare and talk about how it is basically slavery. The rest of the world is happy with their universal healthcare and it's becoming more and more obvious that the USA cannot continue to be so backward in this respect forever.",
Cool argument that would work if we didn't rank near last when it comes to quality for the amount we pay. We pay by the far the most and we get the least of it when you compare us to other industrialized nations. >Are you suggesting that everyone should be happy to see their quality of care decline and massive wait lines and higher taxes take its place?I'd like to find a solution that allows people to access health care without going bankrupt. Or having to use the ER for little things because they can't afford insurance. You see things like that will have an effect on our costs whether you like it or not.But I can tell a solution isn't what folks like you are looking for just repeating the same broken record argument about taxes and waiting lines.,
Single-payer national health insurance also known as ‰ÛÏMedicare for all‰Ûù is a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health care financing but the delivery of care remains largely in private hands. Under a single-payer system all residents of the U.S. would be covered for all medically necessary services including doctor hospital preventive long-term care mental health reproductive health care dental vision prescription drug and medical supply costs.The program would be funded by the savings obtained from replacing today‰Ûªs inefficient profit-oriented multiple insurance payers with a single streamlined nonprofit public payer and by modest new taxes based on ability to pay. Premiums would disappear; **95 percent of all households would save money.** Patients would no longer face financial barriers to care such as co-pays and deductibles and would regain free choice of doctor and hospital. Doctors would regain autonomy over patient care. [source](http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what-is-single-payer),
We're definitely on the same page here.  Absolutely.  And for the love of god can we get some preventative/educational healthcare so we start preventing problems instead of endlessly treating them??  I actually think if the government was footing the bill for the health of their citizens there would suddenly come about a new push in that direction. Sad thing is that I actually think the lifestyle changes would be even harder to sell than single-payer.  If there's one thing we know it's that the American people don't like to hear that they're responsible for something or have to do hard work to gain something.  I mean we like to say that sort of thing to other people to motivate them but we sure don't like it coming in our direction!,
"Lol. Well there's the issue. That's not the bill by the way. That's just an image of some text.The bill is a companion bill to the House bill H.R.676 which makes it illegal to duplicate coverage but allows for supplemental private insurance. This is common in many countries with a universal public health insurance system (and also common with **our** public health insurance system Medicare supplements are a thing).So like I said... You're wrong.EDIT: You've added the Vox article... Which I guess is still better than that ridiculous image. It's still just a poorly worded ""summary"" and not actual legislation ... It also still says *in almost all cases*...",
Every form?  Firemen already provide emergency medical services for most Americans...they *literally* provide a large and important piece of US healthcare already and they do an excellent job all on the taxpayer's dime.  You can't just cry foul every time someone blows up your argument.But whatever.  96% of all physicians are already Participating Providers in Medicare.  That means they voluntarily agree to the rates the government pays.  Are 96% of all doctors wage slaves?  Seniors love their Medicare.  How is this immoral and unjust?  It's not.  By the way doctors can opt for balanced billing if they want.  They can take whatever Medicare pays and bill the patient for the rest.  Only 4% do that.  Seems like you're climbing up on a pretty high horse over a fat lot of nothing.,
That's really good to know! Thanks for sharing that. I'm not sure how the math works out but I would assume that that's probably cheaper than the system we have now. All I know is the way it is now it's almost impossible for me to provide insurance to my employees. Every insurance company I talked to wanted me to have ALL my employees take the insurance for them to offer coverage. And some companies just flatly refused to insure us because there wouldn't be enough employees to make it worth their while. I pay all my employees above minimum wage offer shift differentials and pay double time for holidays just to try to stay competitive. Also I give out bonuses to anyone that picks up shifts and for Christmas. So even if I had to pay for part of their health insurance I could adjust those other benefits a bit to help offset the added cost. ,
They would still make that law though so they'd still be setting their own salary. I think the way it is now is fine. I think the problem is we the people are too hard on them when they want to raise the salary because it's more than we make. You want people outside the business/finance world to be attracted to these jobs. They're at $174k right now. That seems like a lot but they have to travel a ton and pay for a mortgage and rent and other extras that come with the job so I still think it's too low.,
Because modern weapon systems in aircraft missiles and spacecraft take about 10-15 years to come online.  They can't be welded together by car mechanics like WWII tanks were they have to be designed by the best aerospace engineers and computer integrators in the world nearly a decade ahead of when they're needed.  So unfortunately we have to stay on the cutting edge of technology if we're going to deter peer-states like China and Russia from expanding.  But I totally agree with Jack that we don't need to USE all these weapons all the time in many tiny proxy wars.  We just DO need to develop and train on them years ahead of time because in the next big war air and naval superiority will be decided in a matter of weeks.  ,
"Part of the reason they didn't flee is that the rest of the developed world had taxes which were just as high if not higher. After WWII European nations needed very high tax rates to pay off war debt and to pay for rebuilding efforts (as well as for things like healthcare which were established in the wake of the war). The Beatles song ""Taxman"" is a lament that the highest marginal tax rate in Britain was 95% (""Let me tell you how it will be/it's one for you nineteen for me.""). This rate was significantly rolled back under Thatcher. France did institute a wealth tax a few years ago and it did drive several billionaires out of the country. There are limits to what people will tolerate *if they have other options.*  The rich in the US had no better options in the 50s 60s and 70s but with the rise of multinational corporations the internet lowered tax rates in developed countries and developing countries that are much more developed than they were 40 years ago there are a lot more viable options for people to move to for tax avoidance. There is still ample room to raise taxes on the rich but we shouldn't naively think that we can set rates as high as we want. ",
Not actually that easy because the economy functions on numbers magnitudes higher than that and is very complex. Bigger numbers than that are invested every second in this nation often by individuals on everything from pharmaceutical research to the food you eat. Let's not even get into the myriad of ways to hide wealth. This is an unworkable idea on its face. Who will administer this how will they enforce it how will the wealth be redistributed how much wealth will move overseas how much will never be created due to disincentive? 'Easy' plans are usually easy because they ignore reality completely for the sake of sounding good. This is one of those plans. ,
In what way is it dishonest? I‰Ûªm not pretending it‰Ûªs a perfect analogy. I said it‰Ûªs a _callback to_. Does it seem like we‰Ûªre in the 14th century? Of course not. But drawing comparisons to systems distinct in character can reveal similarities in _function_. The analogous part is that people are attached to and dependent on their employer. Go outside the major cities into flyover country. Entire towns are dependent on a single company. The only way you leave that town is through that company. They provide your health insurance policy. Even in major cities you see this where housing incentives provided by large institutions (or rentals from property they own) are effectively the only way to obtain a home at a remotely reasonable price. Can you leave if you want to? Sure. But the average person in such a situation can‰Ûªt just up and leave without unduly endangering themselves and their family (both in health and in financial well-being). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_lock,
Eh?I don't think you got the point.If you're for not having a competitive minimum wage because it's ultimately bad for some reasons then how low exactly do you need to keep a person's wages so they and the system don't get hurt by... Making too much money?People on an hourly wage have a fixed income. How can they ever prosper of they don't make money above what they get to provide for basic needs?If all they're afforded is a life of work eat sleep and work again because they're wages aren't high enough how can they ever move forward?,

>By your own admission people did not know him very well. How is this other people's fault?Bernie not being known six months before primaries to people that have never had reason to know him is a little much. Especially when you don't get the recognition in the news like Hillary did. It took months for any news broadcast stations to take him seriously and when they did everyone knew who he was. He couldn't just e-mail NBC NEWS and tell them to talk about him like Hillary could. The support for Bernie when at peak was insane selling out auditoriums and gathering very large crowds whenever he toured. Hillary did not have these crowds and supporters. >She built that not her husband. She built that because of her husband. She wouldn't have the name she wouldn't have the celebrity status if not for her husband. Her running for senate and won because of her husband (because she sure as shit wouldn't have been a name otherwise). Running (and losing) for president for good reason. Served in the cabinet as a pity and prep her to run for president again. All of these positions were not warranted by any major accomplishment or policy changes she made but on the foundation of her being first lady. She is basically a name known for her husband and not her accomplishments. Like Trump is just a name.>If primary voters didn't know much about him during the primary this is his and his campaign's fault no one else's.People did know about him unfortunately as I stated in my post not six months in advance like some areas (like new york) needed to to vote. Bernie also didn't have the DNC in his pocket like Hillary did. And ultimately she lost the presidency. Who's fault was that? Bernie's? Trumps? Only Hillary. Bernie was the only way to beat Trump honestly and we knew that before the primaries were over. Hillary needs to go away.And I'm sure the American people know enough about Bernie to vote for him in the next election.,

Last estimate over 40% of Americans are uninsured or under insured.What do you think the wait time for those folks is?   I've had 2 knee replacements.  The wait time is more than 10 days that's just flat a lie.  I had to wait about that long to see my primary.Then it took about 30 days to get the referral to a specialist approved from my insurance.  After I found a specialist that was willing to take my insurance it was over 2 months to be able to get in to see him.  After he looked at my records examined me and determined that yes I indeed need knee replacement.It took six weeks to get approval from my insurance company for the procedure.  After all my pre-surgery stuff was done it was still almost 3 weeks before I got a surgical slot.Before I was officially on the schedule to have the surgery I had to pay my surgeon $1500 up front and the hospital $2200 up front.  This is for each knee by the way not all together.  I'm lucky enough that I had the money I bet the above would be problematic for quite a few people.I had the surgery and had to pay almost $2000 more in various copays and fees.  All of the above doesn't factor in all the office copays and the copays I had to pay for tests and steroid shots the insurance company said I had to try before they would approve the surgery.But sure having to wait for a surgical slot for a few months is way worse than dealing with all of the above.Please don't spread misinformation and lies.,
"Checking if being overweight is within a persons control seems like a minefield of lawsuits waiting to happen for negligible gain. Even just gathering and storing if a person is overweight against their will without violating civic rights would probably be a legislative challenge.It also does not seem to fit with your later description of that system being applied to regions and large companies instead of individuals.There is definitely no such system in Germany and just suggesting something even remotely similar to what you described would probably be political suicide here. I never heard of any neighboring country doing something like that before today either.There was public discussion about making people with ""risky lifestyles"" (smoking dangerous hobbies) pay more for their health insurance a few years ago but that was turned down quickly too.I would still be very interested if you could dig out anything more substantial about this.",
I think considerably is a stretch. It will certainly help but the issues with mental health care and the homeless are more complicated than just not being able to get treatment. I'm not trying to be a downer but I just think we need to manage people's expectations. Single payer isn't a cure all it won't even fix a good chunk of the problems that drive up healthcare costs in the US. What it *will* do is give us a stable base so that we can tackle actual solutions to systemic problems instead of just running around trying to put Band-Aids on everything. Achieving universal coverage is just the start of what will likely be a decades long process to unfuck our system.Edit: grammar  ,
"> Well that's the exact stance of Bernie & other democratic socialists so you're in good company.Social democrats* Democratic socialism is something else. If Bernie or others have called themselves the latter they simply mixed the two up. I see that a lot in US politics but rarely in European.I hate to quote wikipedia on matters like these but I'm a bit in a hurry:Demsos:> Democratic socialists see capitalism as inherently incompatible with the democratic values of liberty equality and solidarity; and believe that the issues inherent to capitalism can only be solved by superseding private ownership with some form of social ownership. [...] capitalism can never be sufficiently ""humanized"" and that it must therefore ultimately be replaced with socialism.Sosdem:> Social democracy is a political social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a capitalist economy as well as a policy regime involving a commitment to representative democracy measures for income redistribution and regulation of the economy in the general interest and welfare state provisions.",
Here's the thing. I usually only go into the hospital when I am really *really* hurt. To the point I can no longer manage my pain on my own.I had a bout of gout this year and with my insurance my trip to urgent care and the steroids they gave me I only ended up paying like $50 VS the $300.00 bill I would have normally got.But I don't get sick or hurt often so while I appreciate the fact my insurance makes sure I can go to the hospital 90% of the year I feel like I'm being ripped off. I feel like I should be sick more just to justify the costs.There needs to be some sort of sliding scale that changes how much you pay based on how often you use it. If I'm low risk and only use my insurance once a year it shouldn't be almost $3000.00 a year for insurance. ,
Yeah but it would be one unified system instead of dozens. It's an economy of scale and small optimizations to that system could have big impact whereas now it is reduced because it is just one of many.For one thing the computer systems that my mother used sounded dreadful. I am programmer and just listening to her workflow I could identify many optimizations.Revisions of the code could be simplified preferring uniformity over granularity which could make the process easier especially for smaller clinics.Coding education could be more standardized and more widely disseminated.It's not like its going to be perfect but I do believe that the economy of scale is really going to drive cost reduction in the long term.,
">A family of 4 could be a middle class single income home frequently found in Republican states that would vote against this with 2 parents and 2 kids.  Are you assuming 4 person family means all 4 people are working?  Both adults are working?  THAT is misleading. No a generic family of four is generally 2 adults and 2 children with a gross salary of $50k in this example. Based on a 4% tax increase a yearly cost of $466 puts their adjusted gross income at ~$11k. Based on IRS reporting only 19% of US households have an AGI of $12k or less which means 80% of households would pay *more* than the $466 he stated. Why not use median AGI? Edit: Hold up these calculations may be wrong. His ""how do we pay for it"" PDF had a 4% tax his webpage says 2.2%. Edit2: the numbers on his webpage  don't even match the numbers on the PDF detailing funding options that he released on the same day. With a 4% tax and paying $860 a year that assumes an AGI closer to the 40th percentile of households  which is better but again why not just go with the median? Also the discrepancy between the documents really makes me question how well this was reviewed. >The 1.4 trillion estimate is what experts who have evaluated the plan have said it would cost. What experts? Where is their detailed explanation for costs? >He's had this reviewed.By who? I'm not trying to be rude but seriously where are these numbers coming from? Vague appeals to authority are not sufficient for this kind of discussion.  >His old cost estimate was absurdly low and deserved to be shouted down.  Hell I did.  His numbers add up quite well tho admittedly they are based on assumed administrative cost savings. No they really don't. He starts off by saying that this plan will save over $6 trillion over 10 years. That's $600 billion a year which lines up with the expected $133 billion in pharma cost savings and the $500 billion in admin savings (which is *extremely* generous but I'll go with it for the sake of arguement). The $1.4 billion number is literally just the total National Healthcare Expenditure minus all government spending (or conversely spending by private insurance companies and total out of pocket expenses). Adding $1.4 trillion to current government spending gives you what we currently spend on healthcare. And then we save an additional $600 billion... How exactly?  Or is that $600 billion supposed to cover all the new services? In which case we aren't technically saving money we're just getting more care for the same amount but I digress... Where are the numbers that show projected utilization under this new plan? How did they derieve them? It's just all too vague to derieve any meaningful conclusions about the economic feasibility of such a plan and I guarantee you that you'll hear that same sentiment coming from healthcare economists in the coming days. Have you ever stopped to consider why the experts in this topic healthcare policy makers and healthcare economists aren't collectively shouting from the rooftops about how great this idea is?    ",
The GOP couldn't find the votes or a way to pay for it.  The democrats have the same problem.  The Dems need *at least* 60 votes in the senate to make this happen.Raising taxes is going to be a big hurdle for this bill.  In Western Europe to pay for larger welfare states they often have a VAT (which is basically a sales tax) idk if Americans would go for that.  Sure we could add more taxes on the rich but it will without a doubt require some tax increase on everyone else to be workable.I'm actually sympathetic to single-payer as a program but I am *very* skeptical of this bill.,

The insurance is not the issue... Well not the main one.It's privatized health care. The demand will never go away. Hell it's not in the industry's interest to go away or even down. But unlike forced obsolescence in tech bullshit this is human health. People would give up an arm and a leg... to save an arm and a leg. This is the demand imbalance that makes healthcare hard to fit into capitalism.On the other hand health care does require money and resources.Insurance is supposed to make it easier to afford healthcare. And if it's easier to afford there is more money to be made so the prices go up. Because profit is the king. In healthcare.,

Implementating single payer isn't a a magic bullet that will suddenly lower costs to an acceptable level. The most generous estimates show that switching will reduce per capita costs by 20% when we currently pay nearly double what even the most expensive countries with universal coverage pay. Some of those savings we could achieve immediately simply by letting Medicare negotiate with drug companies but that would just be incremental improvement wouldn't it? What we *have* done is slow the rise in costs with the ACA which bought us some time to figure something else out. Without that incremental change we'd be in worse shape than we currently are.   ",
">The ACA was a half attempt because the republicans wouldn't let us do a system like what is being proposed here. They didn't ""let"" you do the ACA either you just rammed it through without any of their votes.If you were going to shove something down our throats at least make it taste good for fucks sake. You guys could have forced along this magically better ""single payer"" system to begin with but the corporate lobbyists who wrote the bill for you didn't want their cash cows to disappear.>Plus they refused federal money in a number of states which caused it to not work as intended costing people like you extraNot for nothing but that didn't happen to me. I live in California. The system still sucks here.",
"My family is nowhere near the higher tax brackets we are ""middle class"".We had the pleasure of seeing our premiums jump ~$400/month our deductibles shoot up from $1500 -> $6500 Dental and Vision dropped off our plan and considered ""optional add-ons"".Add to that the family doctor we've used since we were kids is now ""out of network"" and we had to pick a new guy who just pushes pills at us for everything we pay the deductible to complain about.It may seem ""give and take"" from another side of it all we ever see are the ""take and fuck you take some more"" side of it.",
">ACA did increase coverageIn terms of ""people covered"" sure I'll give you that.In terms of ""X/Y/Z services are now covered"" I'd have loved to see that. Instead we got our ""cadilac plan"" (that covered Dental and Vision) dropped by the provider and re-sold to us at 4x the monthly cost with a deductible 3x higher with higher copays and with Vision and Dental as ""extra cost"" options. >so healthcare does cost less now than it would without the ACANot for my family it doesn't.>So just by that you've been paying for someone else's problems because that's how risk pools work.Of course which is just fine by me.Becky Sue and I all pay into a risk pool and when something happens we can benefit from what we all put in.The new system we have (that Sanders is trying to expand) is Becky Sue and I all pay into a risk pool. Jose George Mike Billy Tom Dick Harry all **don't** pay into the risk pool but still get to benefit from it.Now when Becky/Sue/I want to get something done it costs more than it used to because there's less money left in the pool.",
I disagree. The wealth gap today hasn't been this high since the Great Depression. The country has been moving right (not just republicans but Democrats too starting with Bill Clinton's presidency) minimum wage hasn't been adjusted for inflation in years and was higher in the 60s than it is today if you adjust for inflation.When there is a huge wealth gap such as in the Gilded Age (1860s to 1877) the government becomes incredibly corrupt. Lobbyists are able to get whatever they want and Congress does the bidding of its donors aka the corporations which are run by the rich.My biggest understanding is why would the urban population be against the rural population? If that's what you think then the wealthy are winning. They divide us based off of issues other than wealth - i.e. race gender sexual orientation religion location of residence etc. This way people assign to their parties based off of other issues and not economic ones. That means that we can't take collective action against them since we are divided in so many other ways.,
I believe there are copays in the Netherlands (that you can get private insurance to cover if you opt in to that) and other single payer systems although I'm not sure how much they are. I don't know enough to know what various groups could afford the inflection points of where it's too much that it's preventing critical care or so low the system will get overwhelmed so I would leave that to the experts (and would be open to it being needs-based as well). Edit: Just in my head though I was thinking even $5 is enough that you're only gonna go if there's a reason.  Our copay was $20 growing up and we were pretty far from well off but that was manageable. Then eventually it jumped to $40 and I thought that was pretty high for just a co-pay. ,
Maybe you don't live in a large metropolitan area where the next available appointment GPs have is months later.  I could go to the emergency room and see specialists and get a prescription no problem.  However I hardly got to pick my doctor since I had to settle for whoever was taking new patients at the time even with my fancy plan.  That's true for anyone who needs a new Primary Care Physician in the city regardless of the plan they have.  Especially in cities and rural areas not everyone has the luxury of choosing their doctor due to the supply of doctors. That still doesn't refute my original point which is that I don't give a shit who my doctor is as long as they give me the same standard of care as everyone else and they don't act like an ass hole.  Additionally I don't see why you wouldn't be able to choose under single payer which was your whole point.  You'd still be able to pick which doctor to see after everyone is on the same insurance system.,

"I'm just following the ""to each according to his needs from each according to his abilities"" to its logical conclusion. On its surface it seems great but in that rural Wal-Mart situation a person would not be insentivised to work hard. In fact they would be insentivised to find every possible thing wrong with themselves to get the most out of the system. I think it is helpful to look at economics as a system of incentive not just of money. So when you think about how a need based economic system would work think about what is insentivised. It leads to things like what happened to the Kulaks in the soviet union. ",
"Only for non essentials. From The Commonwealth Fund yearly report http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/fund-report/2016/jan/1857_mossialos_intl_profiles_2015_v7.pdf?la=en:> This year's report showed that 41 percent of Canadians reported being able to see their doctor on the same or next day when sick compared to 48 percent of Americans.

Until someone else does a study I'm going with the last study done.",
That article cites a study from 15 years ago to reach its conclusion.[They are coming here for faster access to care they need. ](http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/number-of-canadian-patients-travelling-abroad-for-treatment-increased-by-25-study-finds) The average wait time in Canada is massively larger than the USA. Studies show from GP to specialist to surgeon can take 20 weeks. In the US it's days to a couple weeks. These are facts. The article you sourced even admitted to longer wait times and just tried to make excuses for them. Our cancer survival rate is number one in the world. By far. You guys just keep your head in the sand and ignore anything that could possibly pop your bubble. Use some critical thinking skills and don't just let cognitive dissonance run your life. ,
This has nothing to do with with socialism and globalization. We became number one in the post WW2 years and all the competition was either destroyed by the war or preindustrial. We didn't have universal healthcare because no one had it if we had it we could have stayed #1 longer.Today every country with better healthcare than us has some form of universal healthcare. It is simply not an open discussion dozens of countries have shorter waiting times lower costs and better results than us. There is no simply no argument based on facts or evidence not in favor for a government run healthcare system.,
No but in my experience it's not something that is a big concern.Remember employer-provided health care is a *benefit* to employers in that it makes it harder for employees to leave.   The cost is already factored in to the employee's total cost to the company.  In rough numbers if someone makes $60k per year and gets $10k per year in health benefits than their cost to the company is $70k.  It doesn't make much difference to the company if they pay the person the $60k + 10K or $70k.  If the government takes over healthcare is that employee going to get a raise or will the company save $10k a year?If you're interested in why employers started doing this in the first place this article is interesting:http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114045132 ,
>Checking if being overweight is within a persons controlPretty sure that only applies to people that are disabled and they aren't included in the totals.  At least that's how it is in Japan.  I said that to indicate that probably a lot of people in America that are morbidly obese already wouldn't be included in programs like this.  It's also not a per person type of deal which I already said.  They just take measurements of like some percent of randomized people excluding the disabled people and then those people have to meet some total requirements or the company or locality has to pay penalties in the form of fines.It's really not that controversial.  I haven't even heard of a place failing to meet the requirements.,
Something to the effect of noone representing an industry with major financial interests in a given area for am legislator (either physical location or area of political interest) especially one representing an entity with financial contributions more than X-amount can interact directly with a sitting congressman senator etc unless accompanied by a certain number of constituents who make a representative grouping of that official's constituents.While I'd love to just take all the money out of politics this is a more realistically achievable initial goal. Personally I'd shrink the staffs and tax money available to officials give term limits for all elected offices and make it illegal to have lobbying groups purchasing political power. Make them work through the same processes the people have had to and find a way to remind elected officials that this is a service position not a gravy train.,
"Those seeking to profit off of business would just gear toward government positions at that point.

"I suggest you read NPRs take on those numbers.  13.8 is bernies made up number and even liberal Health Centers suggest its more like 18.  Its proposed it would actually cost 32 Trillion in spending and the 13.8-18 you are referring to is the UNFUNDED part that would ADD to our deficit and debt.  That goes hand in hand with his 15 trillion in new taxes.So Bernie wants to raise 15 trillion in NEW taxes and still needs 18 trillion to fund the program in that time. Adding 13-18 trillion over 10 years plus 3 trillion in interest and having no idea how to cover that gap is asinine.  Stop kicking the debt down the road with spending like this.  I use NPR so you cant call fake news.  They have dozens of articles showing the math isnt goingto work on his plan.  And they are Bernie Bros.  Maybe it can be a jumping off point.  But Lets get back to the facts...There is no way to fund this mess with the proposed ""Cuts to Defense Spending"".",

I tend to disagree.The team who takes the most [bases/votes] also usually has the most [runs/EC electors] but it's entirely possible for a [team/candidate] to rack up a huge number of [votes in several large states/3rd base runners who get out] and the other [team/candidate] manages [a single run/51% wins in several smaller states] causing a [30-4 base count in a game with a 0-1 run count/amassive popular win for one candidate while the other wins the electoral college].Votes are not how you win the presidency EC Electors are.

Our cancer patients survive long enough to die from opiates.m and those that get cancer are forever in debt. Cancer survival rates aren't indicative of a successful healthcare system or quality care. A better metric would be average life span obesity rate heart disease and diabetes which in the U.S. ARE becoming epidemics along with cancer. Even with a nuclear reactor failure Japan has healthier people than the U.S. Most of Europe have healthier people Tha the U.S and so does Canada. My mom has battled cancer for 3 years only to become reliant on opiates. She still has cancer. Cancer treatment is fairly primitive as it is and again the survival rate means nothing when the population is more likely to get cancer and die from opiate addictions.,
Maybe but you did kind of bury the lede here. I guess I don't think that the democratic party is divided the vast majority of democrats in Congress are still typical moderates. The Bernie wing is incredibly small in terms of elected officials although certainly it has a significant base. In my opinion the democratic party didn't divide themselves the progressive wing split off and now wants to take over the rest of the party. I think me and most other moderates are more than happy to include the Bernie camp in the democratic party.I am further left than Bernie is but I don't want his message to become the DNCs message. It's the Bernie wing who is refusing to play ball here this is more of a progressive exodus away from the Democratic Party than a division.,
Thank you for the kind advice but I'm already closer to 60 than 50. The thing of it is when you get to this age it is a little harder to get people to hire you. There are at least half a dozen oldies in the same boat as me working in that place and purely for the insurance. And we are tough old shits. This is probably the last job many of us will have. But with single payer the prospect of looking for another job is less frightening. I could go somewhere with slightly shorter hours and perhaps less heavy lifting. Might keep people like me able to stay in the workforce a little longer and off disability.,
"The US pays the most per capita because of the insurance system.  Insurers are not allowed to sell across state lines so they form monopolies on the state.  If those rules were dropped and I as a person in Chicago could choose from Insurance companies based in PA KY OR or MA companies would have to drop their prices to compete.  They don't have to worry about that right now because people have no were else to go there is no true competition.Norway has a small population that hardly grows year over year.  It is sustainable.  The US literally adds hundreds of thousands of people a year up to 70% not contributing in taxes.  The US having a single payer system is like all of Western Europe operating under one system.  I would argue to first drop the state line boundary for insurance companies and watch how the packages turn to favor the consumer in order to keep revenue flow constant.As far as single payer goes I would argue that it would be better for each state to have their own single payer system.  They are aware of their needs and are easier to hold accountable financially.  Especially considering that even the poorest US states have higher GDPs than many of the wealthier western European countries.What it comes down to is that the ""US pays the most per capita"" argument is purely because of our insurance system.  Drop those lines allow ten-fold the competition allow competition to drive down price to satisfy the new sea of options for consumers.  Allow the government to pick up the rest.",
"And thus why industries should be separate entities from government even in a socialist society.

I agree that the scale of this is much larger than defense - and more to the point defense has already been several cut by the sequester and there's not a lot more blood in that turnip anyway.But that $32 trillion number is total healthcare spending. Under the current system the equivalent number is $49 trillion.You can oppose single payer for a lot of reasons but cost is not one of them. It's cheaper than for-profit as has been proven time and again around the world through direct operational evidence. If single payer was going to bankrupt us or create unsustainably high tax burdens or whatever it would already have done so in Canada. It hasn't; it has instead been extremely successful.What's unsustainable is expecting a family of four to pay $2000/month in premiums to an insurance company. This is a tax in all but name - despite the conservative argument that it's a contract between private individuals and thus not a tax. If you don't pay it you will be met with violence - not by men with guns but by the cold indifference of a society willing to just let you die. If you say taxation is theft then I say insurance premiums are theft and we both have equal support for our absurd positions.,

- Guidance and supplemental information are two entirely different things. Your source is from a time before Brazile had even admitted that she leaked debate questions to Clinton.- Staffers *only* openly coming up with potential ways to drag one of the candidates through the mud doesn't inspire confidence in the Party.- That doesn't make them any less undemocratic. Nor does it keep people unfamiliar with the election process from assuming that Clinton is too far ahead for Sanders to be a relevant candidate from day one. Superdelegates as establishment democrats undermine candidates who don't strictly follow the party line.- Compare the 2008 primaries' total [26 debates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums_2008) that began in April to the 2016 primaries' total of [9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums_2016) that began in October.

Think about it though. Who would work if they knew they were guaranteed all of their needs met? I understand that there are people who are unable to make a living wage for My number of reasons.

But their conclusion that the reason for the numbers must be the long wait times seems pulled directly out of thin air to match their political philosophy. Shown by the fact that they say it ""may"" be because or it's ""possible"" the reason is... They even say ""In 2014 an estimated 52513 Canadians receive **non-emergency medical treatment** outside Canada"" and then later in that same paragraph say they left ""perhaps to save their own lives ""btw comparatively 1.4 million Americans leave the country for medical treatment. http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/08/17/14-Million-Americans-Will-Go-Abroad-Medical-Care-Year-Should-You And it's apparently not because of wait times those are great. We do it to save money because health care is unaffordable here. Only incredibly wealthy Canadians could come here for treatment. ",
You're right about Insurance being one of the reasons why we pay so much but you're missing out on the huge reason why they're so costly.  And it's not becasue of statelines  Under Obamacare 80% of healthcare costs must go directly into healthcare.  That means 20% goes into profits and insurance bureaucracy.   Compare this to medicare's 2% that goes into bureaucracy.  If most of our health care dollars go into single payer that's an 18% savings right there.  Another big costs saving would be to finally get out Medicare Part D and finally allow Medicare to negotiate prices for medicine.  Whether you're for against Bernie's plan you've gotta like that.  The problem with dropping State insurance state lines is that it might all devolve into the worse and cheapest plans kind of like Delaware is now where almost everysingle business is incorporated.  This could be a huge problem that occur if questions about liability and enforcement against rogue insurance companies.And yes the United States is massive but that's why it makes for such a great candidate for economies of scale. >As far as single payer goes I would argue that it would be better for each state to have their own single payer system. They are aware of their needs and are easier to hold accountable financially. Especially considering that even the poorest US states have higher GDPs than many of the wealthier western European countries.This is the same position as Nancy Pelosi's.  though I'm not sure if you care or not.,
>History is replete with examples of these modes of production essentially being a proxy for slavery.Yes but history shows that trying to change things to a communist system generally just creates a different form of slavery rather than solving the problem.>Also you never answered my question. On what moral basis should there be billionaires?On what moral basis should Americans have their current standards of living? Do you support opening the borders and letting everyone who wants to come to the US come here knowing that this would probably reduce everyone's standard of living to slightly above third-word standards?On what moral basis do you have housing?

Uk Population 65 million.USA Population 321 Million.  With different laws across 50 states 3 territories and DC.Yeah you're right comparing the UK Canada or any other sub 100 million Country to the US isn't Apples and Oranges.Literally a single US State is bigger than most countries.  Switching the healthcare system we use 180 degrees isn't going to happen it's not magic guy.  A lot of people will lose things in the switch a lot of people will gain things and  avast majority won't really see a difference.I have personally taken and kept working jobs just because of the healthcare.  As have many other people.  Take Love's Tire Care Center.  You think people actually want to work in 110 degree Texas heat changing semi tires for 11 bucks an hour?  Nope but Love's has some of the best healthcare and benefits packages available.  Who know who else pays 11 bucks an hour?  The Front Desk at a shitty slow as fuck hotel.  But it offers no benefits.I know which one I'd rather do if healthcare was free.,
From the very same article: >It may be painful but at some point we as a profession need to recognize that we are getting compensated very well and that we too will have to make sacrifices to maintain the solvency of our health care system. One of our duties in caring for our patients is making sure they can afford the care they need and if that means that I have to drop from the 94th to the 92nd percentile in income I‰Ûªm willing to take the hit.First the article describes a 12% reduction on average for doctors making that 20-25% reduction you threw out very misleading. That would apply only to specialists. Who on the lower end would still make over $280000 per year minimum. They'll live. Second we don't know exactly which system we will end up with so just assuming that doctors would only be paid at the *current* medicare rate or a lower rate is a pretty massive assumption. Medicare for all is one option but even if we go with that who knows what the payment rates would end up as? The road to implementing such a system would be long and determining compensation for doctors would be part of that process. Finally even in the article you provided the author would be for even the type of loss of income you're describing. Why is it that you're so much more concerned about this than *actual* doctors and the AMA? Why is it that doctors in every developed nation with a form of universal/single payer healthcare generally really like those systems? This is really one of the weaker arguments against single payer/universal health care. ,
I would reccomend reading the source.  http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)62038-9/fulltext - let em know if you get pay walled ill find the public version.Your link unsurprisingly removes any sort of setting or circumstance around it.For example those survival rates in the US are calculated on only people who attended a participating cancer clinic not all clinics or medical institutions (Shocking that a cancer clinic might give an inflated report of their results) they compare that against global numbers.  So when they say there is a 80% survival rate thats a 80% of that particular class and type of patient vs the non domestic numbers where they include cancer results as per all other results as a group if they made their data public and i had a few hours i could give you our comparable score.So yes i cede to you that a specialist cancer clinic may be more effective in treating cancer than say a dentist or a chiropodist. but that's all your numbers show CDC are holding an apple in one hand and an orange in the other while saying 'one is green it must be better'.,
You are so kind! I hope your situation improves too and that the world gets better for your generation and that of your child. I have a daughter son in law and seven grandchildren I hope this for too. Congratulations on the little one. Kids are a joy. I will be okay there are a lot of us old fogies out there who have always had to work hard and that's life. My hope is the changes people like Bernie strives for will come to pass for the next generations and we won't have such a shit country anymore. I can just barely remember when things were not so bad. It's now like those damn dystopian Sci-fi books I have read.Good luck to you and take care of that baby. :)P.S. Cannabis and green tea are great for the health also yoga and meditation.,
"Clarify what you mean specifically when you say 80% healthcare costs must go to healthcare.  Costs to the hospitals? costs to the insurers? costs to the end users?My question is how does Medicare have any leverage to negotiate prices? Do you mean negotiate between separate manufacturers or vendors?  like starting a price war between them?  That's a good idea if there weren't limited manufacturers and patented medicine.  Company A comes in with 50$ a pill and Company B comes in with a less effective pill but at 47$ a pill.  The price can only go so low until the low margin forces the companies to sell elsewhere and the person with the cheapest manufacturing costs are going to win.  Cheap manufacturing costs typically mean low quality product.What do you mean every business is incorporated in Deleware?  Of course they're incorporated.  Incorporating is a safety  measure so if the company fails all the debts are physically placed on a select amount of people (I start a company take huge loans to build machines to produce the medicine I just created turns out there is no market I can't sell my pills I owe money on the machines but have no revenue to pay for them.  Thank God I'm incorporated so I don't owe the rest of the money personally.  Reddit loves to use the word ""corporation"" as some evil thing and it makes no sense.  It is an umbrella term to define a necessary legal practice.My argument for dropping state lines is if the people in Delaware don't like what they're offered in Deleware you're free to search the tens of companies in ANY state for the plan that best suits your needs and affordability.  Don't like what's in your state? Feel free to leave.  The companies in Deleware then have to adjust to earn consumers.Reddit loves to shit on Nancy Pelosi and I'm not a fan of the way she got her position but I am a fan of what she was able to do for charter schools and the education growth she spurred in Michigan.  https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/MI_report_2012_FINAL_1_11_2013_no_watermark.pdf She has fantastic business acumen and sharp skills and experience to create economy and drive competition.The problem with visiting this sub and other subs (looking at latestagecapitalism) is that there is SO MUCH counter evidence to what they're talking about but the mods do not allow it.

Yes he's the most popular US politician... Until the polls include Barack Obama or Joe Biden in which case both beat him by a wide margin.But sure when you make a point of excluding all of the most popular actual democrats he's so popular!Give me a god damn break. Bernie isn't proposing a serious plan -it's just more pathetic sloganeering. He's relying on his cult-like fanbase to eat it up like they do everything else - utterly without critical examination.I *desperately* want this country to move toward realistic affordable universal health care that isn't tied to employment. It's pathetic that we have such a broken greedy and haphazard system. That being said Sanders is a joke at best on this issue - just empty slogans and campaign rhetoric no better than the Republicans in that regard.If we want to start talking about a serious transition then lets start talking about automatic enrollment for unenrolled persons rather than a tax penalty. Let's start talking about opening up the law to allow any level of municipal government all the way up to state governments to form their own insurance programs. If a company of 100000 people can offer its employees a generous health package why in the hell couldn't a city of 100000 people use the same leverage and purchasing power to do the same? Or allow any voluntary collective of persons in a geographically cohesive area to pool risk and funds to do the same. Open the market up to real competition by allowing citizens to genuinely collectively bargain.Allow unions to offer health plans to their members too.Then offer a few separate levels of robust public option to put the pressure on private insurers even more. Allow importation of drugs from Canada and start exercising the march-in rights on patents resulting from publicly funded research specified under the 1980 Bayh-Dole act - rights which would allow the government to mandate licensing of those patents. That would begin to quickly break the monopoly many pharmaceuitacal companies enjoy.Start requiring end of life care planning and living wills for all seniors. I've watched a lot of elderly family members pass and those that didn't specify their wishes in advance were left to suffer and cling on in ways that they damn sure wouldn't have wanted. Those who had DNRs and had planned for their own ends went more quickly and with more dignity. End of life care accounts for a massive proportion of healthcare costs - often because other people want to cling to their relatives not because those people want to cling to unconsciousness and pain.Then put more public funding into drug research. Increasing research funding opening the results of that research up to any US company and breaking drug company monopolies would quickly reign those costs in.There are a hell of a lot of approaches that could begin to solve this problem - but **none** of those are in Bernie's bill. It's just a goddamn political gesture when we need actual solutions and that really *really* pisses me off.EDIT: Hell let's take it further. Create refundable tax credits for making your annual and biannual checkups. Create refundable tax credits for gym memberships. Tax the shit out of junk food like Michael Bloomberg tried to do in NYC - and put all that funding towards healthy food programs. Don't allow soda candy ice cream chips etc. to be purchased using food stamps. Take farm subsidies away from corn and put them toward vegetables so that real food isn't more expensive than fake corn-syrup filled garbage. There are so damn many things we could do - none of which are in this damn bill.,
> I'm not saying because it exists in most nations means that it's a good idea but it's a good idea.Alright why is it a good idea?>Hell if Trump produced a true single payer that was good for the people and didn't prioritize corporations over people I would support that too. Bernie supporters are policy supporters not candidate supporters.Except the support of that policy is as I am arguing based on feelings and expediency. Politicians exploit the nature of politics in this manner. It's why they stay in power even when they don't solve problems: they only need to convince people they are solving them have solved them or will solve them.,
Your top link why did you put it there? I mean he is 100% accurate and it only further shows how much better a candidate he was.I'm reading your second link from CCN and thinking that Bernie is 100% correct here. There is no bullshit and he is speaking to the point about decisions she made. She questioned his character and instead of him talking shit he raised her policy and voting history and said that is some examples of why she wouldn't be a good president in his eyes. As far as politics goes that's about as polite as it can possibly get.Thanks for the links was fun reading them.,

The adoption of totalitarian/authoritarian regimes once government seizes capital and consolidates power is a feature of this type of revolution not a bug. It's the inevitable result of this happening. What you are proposing would not (and has not ever) resulted in the world I believe you desire. You can argue against the negative effects of capitalism and private wealth of which there are quite a few but what you cannot argue against is it's superiority compared to consolidated power in the hands of the state which you seem to want (case studies: East/West Germany North/South Korea real time examples of the different philosophies at work).,

A system which is wildly inefficient bankrupts huge numbers of people and results in a large proportion of the citizenry having no adequate healthcare whatsoever. Talk about greed. In return we get a nation of healthy people who contribute substantially more to the national economy. We get an efficient just healthcare system. We get workers with more money in their pockets to spend on goods and services meaning a better tax base.

let's try this again. The one I liked didn't offer a conclusion. That's why I liked it. The one you offered admitted that the number was an estimate and then attempted to offer a political conclusion with zero evidence to back it up. Just because the study is newer doesn't mean that it's somehow automatically a well done study. And again pot kettle you used a 17 year old study to try and make your point. So you don't really seem to care about the age of a study at all. You only seem to care about the age of the study you didn't like.Seems to me like the military does what it's meant to do pretty well. We fought 2 wars at the same time recently you might remember. I would think that requires a high level of competence. They maintain soldiers and bases across the entire world. They move people and equipment all over the world and in and out of warzones. Is there waste. Of course there is they are fucking massive. But if you don't think the Military is efficiently run then I don't know what your definition of efficient is. So how about this. You name an efficiently run nation wide private company that does something on the level of the military. Name me a private company that employs 1.4 million employees across 150 countries with no waste. Equifax maybe?,

First there is zero evidence that universal healthcare = your spouse taking a 25% pay cut. The article you provided in no way claims that's the only outcome. The author did some simple arithmetic based on *all* doctors getting paid at the *current* Medicare rate. That's far from certain to happen if some form of single payer/universal health care is implemented. Second preferring that: the economy take the continued hit of the current healthcare system and people going bankrupt due to health costs or (simply dying) because they can't get affordable treatment all so you can avoid the terror (in your mind) of an income from $280000 up to almost $500000...that's called greed. A hell of a lot of people work hard and planned right and a lot of those people get fucked by the current system. Is their poverty and lack of access to healthcare so much less important than you making all the money you think you're entitled to? Again we call that greed. You could also do you know what so many less fortunate Americans do: dual income household. ,
Your study is 20 years old. It's data is useless. Want me to find a study on the quality of flu treatments from. 1846 to prove something? It's worthless. You can ignore their analysis but the numbers from the new study I shared contradict yours. I shared a newer study when that was pointed out. You haven't offered a newer one backing up your point. The military is a black hole of unaccountable government waste. It's horrifically inefficient. The military is the poster child for the incompetence of our government. We can blow shit up but we throw unlimited funds at it and lose billions and billions and billions with no accountability. There are many incredibly well run international companies that don't waste and are incredibly good at what they do. None at the size of the military but that doesn't excuse the military or in any way prove that the government can handle health care efficiently. ,

"The myth that Canadians came to America for medical treatment existed 20 years ago and it was wrong then as it's wrong now. Your study doesn't actually contradict mine. That's what I keep trying to point out to you. Your study even if we except the numbers said absolutely nothing about the destination of the people leaving Canada for medical treatment. You are drawing the conclusions that you want to believe from a study that doesn't actually say that. A Canadian would be an idiot for coming to the US for medical treatment. It would cost them thousands of dollars more than picking a different country. As evidenced by the fact that 28 times more people leave the US for medical treatment than people that leave Canada.As simple as possible. Your conclusion ""Lots of Canadians are flocking to America for medical treatment"" The Study's conclusion ""Lots of Canadians are leaving Canada for medical treatment"" Those two things are not equal.So that's a no on the gigantic but yet efficient private company? Can you name a company that's even half that big? A quarter? And still efficient? I'm still not sure if you are actually suggesting that the current insurance companies are well run and efficient. Is that your suggestion? Or is it just ""I assume the government would fuck it up because grr! Government bad!

">Because housing is a right that should be guaranteed by a government especially one with the greatest historic wealth of any nation. The choice to either work hard enough to make rent/payments or die from exposure is a blankly immoral one to force a population to make.But it's not the government forcing that choice it's the laws of physics so to speak which result in a world in which there is scarcity. For the government to provide person A with housing it must force person B to work. Sure we could take the rich people's wealth and nationalize it but that would be a one-time thing. Afterward there would be no more rich people.Also I'm not going to try to defend the excessively rich but they do serve an important role in the economy by investing. All the ""abstract"" finance stuff in the modern economy isn't just there as some sort of complex theft scheme although certainly that's part of it. It also enables the economy to perform well. Finance/investment are high-level patterns of coordination in the economy and there's good reason to believe that the private sector can do this more efficiently than the public sector.",
