Question: How long until I have to worry about the next GOP attempt to screw up insurance? Edit: For those of you still coming to this. It appears that it is dead for at least a year. Because this was a budget reconciliation vote it only needed a simple 51 vote majority to pass. Now that it has failed a 60 vote majority will be needed to pass a new healthcare bill.Side note: It appears that if McCain hadn't voted for the debate to proceed then he could have potentially been replaced due to health concerns and the vote could have passed.,0
The story is not what McCain did it's what he had to do at 2 am because his own party was insistent om passing anything.Never forget these moments;- McCain said the bill was terrible but he'd vote for it if he felt sure Ryan wouldn't pass it outright. Same for Graham.- they received a tepid assurance and the House declared Martial Law to repeal some rules and fast track the bill- Not a single Republican mentioned the CBO score or cared.- McConnell was so certain of his victory that he called Pence down.- McConnell called Democrats obstructionists for asking bills to be ready and slowing nominations... The man who stopped Merrick Garland for a year and held up Obama noms for years on end.- even at just 50 votes needed and with a majority McConnell still failed.- Conservative Dems we're never even in play! Any Congress watchers know that's a pretty crazy thing.- McConnell still forced vulnerable Republicans to vote No even after the bill failed like Heller.They came at 2 am for your healthcare fully aware the bill they were passing would be an unmitigated disaster. They shut down proteata ended town halls and ignored polls. They risked everything with endless ammunition against the for midterms. Just to do something they KNEW would raise cost and remove people from healthcare.But the constituent voice still stopped them.Not Trump gets a turn. Let's see what he tries to break and see if people are paying attention.Edit: on mobile so sorry you gotta live with the typos.,0
This is a historic moment. And as I watch Mitch McConnell is trying to blame this on anyone but the GOP.Truth is no one wanted this not even the GOP.The road forward is either Single Payer or to make ObamaCare fixed.The end results means one single thing:WE WON those who spoke emailed wrote letters called and otherwise contacted congress.We have done this. And we have reason to be proud. Now we need to fix the problems that exist with the ACA or to move to Single Payer.More important we need to keep arguing to get this incapable admin out of office. It may be that we need to press congress to keep Bob Mueller on the job there is currently a law composed by Senator Graham to prevent Trump from firing Mueller.Our nation has other very important goals to discuss.Let's get to it.The democrats are reaching out to work through these things.Will the GOP work or help with this?Let's do this.,0
"McCain just pulled a ""face turn"" on us. God damn it I haven't been this happy in MONTHS!-McConnell has been defeated AGAIN.-Healthcare is more than likely saved for now (at least if the GOP doesn't touch this till after midterms.)-The GOP look mighty crazy criminal even. They can spin it against the Dems all they want; they went through this bullshit for nothing. So they anger the constituents who wanted this AND piss off people to the other side come 2018.-President Sex Offender has no healthcare bill to sign. But what he does have is a Russian Sanctions Bill to mull over.Just ecstatic. We saved healthcare so now let's get our Internet Rights protected!",0
1. Good work Chuck Schumer for keeping the Democrates unified during this horrific process.2. Shout out to everyone who resisted - called protested emailed and made their voices heard.3. A special shoutout to Collins & Murkowski who put country over party through the bullying and harassment from the GOP.4. Good for John McCain for doing the right thing.5. Extra extra shout out to McConnell and the GOP for being such a massive fucking incompetent dumpster fire. 6. Lastly but not least a big round of applause to Donald for being such a massive gigantic yuge failure on ALL fronts.  ,0
I've got a couple of questions about some of these Republicans.Both Rand Paul (R-KY) and Mike Lee (R-UT) said they couldn't support earlier versions of the Senate bill because it kept too much of Obamacare in place.  This bill literally only repealed the individual mandate the employer mandate and the medical device tax.  But it left all those requirements on insurance companies pre-existing conditions and subsidies and tax rebates - which he said he was against in the earlier bills that also repealed the mandates.So what made those two hypocrites OK with this version which repeals the least amount of Obamacare to date?The other person I want to hear from is the Senator from Nevada who seems to now be fine with fucking over his state. . .,0
"BWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!These guys couldn't legislate themselves out of a wet paper bag.There you go conservatives.  There's the people you put into office.   They can't even agree with themselves.   They're so intractable and stubborn and frankly giant dillholes that they can't get ANYTHING done.   So congratulations on throwing a bunch of idiot assholes who can't get along with anyone even themselves  at government to ""fix"" it.  You angry Trump voters sure did send a message about how you want government cleaned up.  How do you fix your cars?   Cram a bunch of dynamite in your starter?",0
"WINNING!!!> ""We are gonna win win win. We're going to win with military we're going to win at the borders we're going to win with trade we're going to win at everything. And some of you are friends and you're going to call and you're going to say 'Mr. President please we can't take it anymore we can't win anymore like this Mr. President you're driving us crazy you're winning too much please Mr. President not so much and I'm going to say I'm sorry we're going to keep winning because we are going to make America great again.""-Donald J(ackass) TrumpHow does this win feel Donnie?",0
"The vote tonight gives me so much hope that the senate will do what so many have been calling for and relax some of the partisanship. If you listen to the measured reactions on both sides you can tell that there is some sincere hope for both sides to work together on healthcare and other issues going forward. A perfect example of the changing attitude is when Schumer instantly quieted the celebration by some staffers/junior members when McCain said ""No"". If the Senate can get away from the adversarial outlook they have had for the better part of the last decade and return to honest deliberations and leadership we will all benefit. ",0
"I hope everyone who wished McCain death and suffering takes a long look at themselves.  There was a guy who said ""I hope he [McCain] suffers and his family has to watch"".  The man is a fucking human being and from what I've seen of him a decent person.  He's spent his life in service of his country.  I don't agree with most of his politics (hell I might even venture to say I don't agree with any of his politics) and voted against him way back when but the people who fucking *celebrated* his cancer diagnosis need to take a long hard look at themselves in the mirror and find out what the FUCK is the matter with their moral compass that they would be happy that someone will suffer and die leaving his family in mourning.  I'm happy as hell that this bill fucking failed.  I was frustrated that the republican controlled congress was at an advantage to getting it passed.  But to make posts practically thrilled about McCain dying?  You are part of what is wrong with this partisan as fuck country.",0
7 years to figure this out. Instead years of Benghazi birth certificates tan suits and shutdowns.  Now they have power and what have they got - nothing.  They were elected on their ability to weasel and not get things done.  They cannot govern and if they try its about paying back the companies billionaires and to steal everything not nailed down.  Their oaths mean nothing. Now we have a call to investigate Hillary yet again while undermining the real problems. They want to chase their social agenda and build a wall which we never needed.  If you were hired to fix this the first thing you would do would be to bring in the Marines.,0
"Politics has officially become WWE!  I for one am compelled to watch this.1. This week we've got The Mooch ranting and raving and making threats like a coked out Scott Steiner.  I'm surprised Mean Gene wasn't standing next to him.2. Then we've got McCain leaving the hospital to destroy Obamacare.  ""Fans McCain is on his way to Washington....look out Democrats!""3. Then in the dead of night sneak attack on healthcare the now...I mean Conservatives try to take a vote.  McCain leaves the room.  Vote is about to pass when...what's this?!!?  ""Fans it's McCain from the back....he's got a bat in his hand and has cleared the ring of his nWo mates!!!!!  WTF is going on here???!!!  He's signaling something!  Oh my Gawd McCain just did a Stone Cold Stunner on the repeal bill!!!!!!  By Gawd!!!!!  He's turned against the nWo.  Look at Hollywood McConnell!  He can't believe it!!!!!""""Fans!!!  We've gotta goooooooooo!!!!!!!""",0
"This doesn't mean we can relax. In fact it is the exact opposite. We need to watch the administration like never before. If the administration moves to defund the subsidies low-income people can get it doesn't matter if the law is still in place. Those people are still going to lose their insurance. Even people who *can* afford the plans are going to feel it as insurance companies pull out or jack up premiums to (more) obscene levels.Just because they failed to repeal it from the books doesn't mean they can't dynamite the bridge and collapse the whole damn thing on itself. Worse they'll say ""We told you it would implode on itself!"" as they brush the blasting caps under the rug.",0
"I don't understand McCain. He has always struck me as a well intentioned kid with the wrong group of friends. He talks the talk sometimes but hardly ever walks the walk. His legacy seems to be filled with ""Uh guys I don't think this is a good idea"" but him doing it anyway. He is very contradictory. But in this instance I'm glad he finally stuck to his word even if it took public outcry and a second chance. Granted far too many voters were calling for his death. But our political climate is at the worst state its ever been in so many seem to have thrown rationale and morals out the door just like the president. McCain only has a few months left and I think he's starting to come to terms with it. Finally doing what he thinks instead of what his buddies tell him to. I hope it's the case. ",0
