Question: How long until I have to worry about the next GOP attempt to screw up insurance? Edit: For those of you still coming to this. It appears that it is dead for at least a year. Because this was a budget reconciliation vote it only needed a simple 51 vote majority to pass. Now that it has failed a 60 vote majority will be needed to pass a new healthcare bill.Side note: It appears that if McCain hadn't voted for the debate to proceed then he could have potentially been replaced due to health concerns and the vote could have passed.,
The story is not what McCain did it's what he had to do at 2 am because his own party was insistent om passing anything.Never forget these moments;- McCain said the bill was terrible but he'd vote for it if he felt sure Ryan wouldn't pass it outright. Same for Graham.- they received a tepid assurance and the House declared Martial Law to repeal some rules and fast track the bill- Not a single Republican mentioned the CBO score or cared.- McConnell was so certain of his victory that he called Pence down.- McConnell called Democrats obstructionists for asking bills to be ready and slowing nominations... The man who stopped Merrick Garland for a year and held up Obama noms for years on end.- even at just 50 votes needed and with a majority McConnell still failed.- Conservative Dems we're never even in play! Any Congress watchers know that's a pretty crazy thing.- McConnell still forced vulnerable Republicans to vote No even after the bill failed like Heller.They came at 2 am for your healthcare fully aware the bill they were passing would be an unmitigated disaster. They shut down proteata ended town halls and ignored polls. They risked everything with endless ammunition against the for midterms. Just to do something they KNEW would raise cost and remove people from healthcare.But the constituent voice still stopped them.Not Trump gets a turn. Let's see what he tries to break and see if people are paying attention.Edit: on mobile so sorry you gotta live with the typos.,
This is a historic moment. And as I watch Mitch McConnell is trying to blame this on anyone but the GOP.Truth is no one wanted this not even the GOP.The road forward is either Single Payer or to make ObamaCare fixed.The end results means one single thing:WE WON those who spoke emailed wrote letters called and otherwise contacted congress.We have done this. And we have reason to be proud. Now we need to fix the problems that exist with the ACA or to move to Single Payer.More important we need to keep arguing to get this incapable admin out of office. It may be that we need to press congress to keep Bob Mueller on the job there is currently a law composed by Senator Graham to prevent Trump from firing Mueller.Our nation has other very important goals to discuss.Let's get to it.The democrats are reaching out to work through these things.Will the GOP work or help with this?Let's do this.,
McCain just pulled a "face turn" on us. God damn it I haven't been this happy in MONTHS!-McConnell has been defeated AGAIN.-Healthcare is more than likely saved for now (at least if the GOP doesn't touch this till after midterms.)-The GOP look mighty crazy criminal even. They can spin it against the Dems all they want; they went through this bullshit for nothing. So they anger the constituents who wanted this AND piss off people to the other side come 2018.-President Sex Offender has no healthcare bill to sign. But what he does have is a Russian Sanctions Bill to mull over.Just ecstatic. We saved healthcare so now let's get our Internet Rights protected!,
1. Good work Chuck Schumer for keeping the Democrates unified during this horrific process.2. Shout out to everyone who resisted - called protested emailed and made their voices heard.3. A special shoutout to Collins & Murkowski who put country over party through the bullying and harassment from the GOP.4. Good for John McCain for doing the right thing.5. Extra extra shout out to McConnell and the GOP for being such a massive fucking incompetent dumpster fire. 6. Lastly but not least a big round of applause to Donald for being such a massive gigantic yuge failure on ALL fronts.  ,
I've got a couple of questions about some of these Republicans.Both Rand Paul (R-KY) and Mike Lee (R-UT) said they couldn't support earlier versions of the Senate bill because it kept too much of Obamacare in place.  This bill literally only repealed the individual mandate the employer mandate and the medical device tax.  But it left all those requirements on insurance companies pre-existing conditions and subsidies and tax rebates - which he said he was against in the earlier bills that also repealed the mandates.So what made those two hypocrites OK with this version which repeals the least amount of Obamacare to date?The other person I want to hear from is the Senator from Nevada who seems to now be fine with fucking over his state. . .,
BWAH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!These guys couldn't legislate themselves out of a wet paper bag.There you go conservatives.  There's the people you put into office.   They can't even agree with themselves.   They're so intractable and stubborn and frankly giant dillholes that they can't get ANYTHING done.   So congratulations on throwing a bunch of idiot assholes who can't get along with anyone even themselves  at government to "fix" it.  You angry Trump voters sure did send a message about how you want government cleaned up.  How do you fix your cars?   Cram a bunch of dynamite in your starter?,
WINNING!!!> "We are gonna win win win. We're going to win with military we're going to win at the borders we're going to win with trade we're going to win at everything. And some of you are friends and you're going to call and you're going to say 'Mr. President please we can't take it anymore we can't win anymore like this Mr. President you're driving us crazy you're winning too much please Mr. President not so much and I'm going to say I'm sorry we're going to keep winning because we are going to make America great again."-Donald J(ackass) TrumpHow does this win feel Donnie?,
The vote tonight gives me so much hope that the senate will do what so many have been calling for and relax some of the partisanship. If you listen to the measured reactions on both sides you can tell that there is some sincere hope for both sides to work together on healthcare and other issues going forward. A perfect example of the changing attitude is when Schumer instantly quieted the celebration by some staffers/junior members when McCain said "No". If the Senate can get away from the adversarial outlook they have had for the better part of the last decade and return to honest deliberations and leadership we will all benefit. ,
I hope everyone who wished McCain death and suffering takes a long look at themselves.  There was a guy who said "I hope he [McCain] suffers and his family has to watch".  The man is a fucking human being and from what I've seen of him a decent person.  He's spent his life in service of his country.  I don't agree with most of his politics (hell I might even venture to say I don't agree with any of his politics) and voted against him way back when but the people who fucking *celebrated* his cancer diagnosis need to take a long hard look at themselves in the mirror and find out what the FUCK is the matter with their moral compass that they would be happy that someone will suffer and die leaving his family in mourning.  I'm happy as hell that this bill fucking failed.  I was frustrated that the republican controlled congress was at an advantage to getting it passed.  But to make posts practically thrilled about McCain dying?  You are part of what is wrong with this partisan as fuck country.,
7 years to figure this out. Instead years of Benghazi birth certificates tan suits and shutdowns.  Now they have power and what have they got - nothing.  They were elected on their ability to weasel and not get things done.  They cannot govern and if they try its about paying back the companies billionaires and to steal everything not nailed down.  Their oaths mean nothing. Now we have a call to investigate Hillary yet again while undermining the real problems. They want to chase their social agenda and build a wall which we never needed.  If you were hired to fix this the first thing you would do would be to bring in the Marines.,
Politics has officially become WWE!  I for one am compelled to watch this.1. This week we've got The Mooch ranting and raving and making threats like a coked out Scott Steiner.  I'm surprised Mean Gene wasn't standing next to him.2. Then we've got McCain leaving the hospital to destroy Obamacare.  "Fans McCain is on his way to Washington....look out Democrats!"3. Then in the dead of night sneak attack on healthcare the now...I mean Conservatives try to take a vote.  McCain leaves the room.  Vote is about to pass when...what's this?!!?  "Fans it's McCain from the back....he's got a bat in his hand and has cleared the ring of his nWo mates!!!!!  WTF is going on here???!!!  He's signaling something!  Oh my Gawd McCain just did a Stone Cold Stunner on the repeal bill!!!!!!  By Gawd!!!!!  He's turned against the nWo.  Look at Hollywood McConnell!  He can't believe it!!!!!""Fans!!!  We've gotta goooooooooo!!!!!!!",
This doesn't mean we can relax. In fact it is the exact opposite. We need to watch the administration like never before. If the administration moves to defund the subsidies low-income people can get it doesn't matter if the law is still in place. Those people are still going to lose their insurance. Even people who *can* afford the plans are going to feel it as insurance companies pull out or jack up premiums to (more) obscene levels.Just because they failed to repeal it from the books doesn't mean they can't dynamite the bridge and collapse the whole damn thing on itself. Worse they'll say "We told you it would implode on itself!" as they brush the blasting caps under the rug.,
I don't understand McCain. He has always struck me as a well intentioned kid with the wrong group of friends. He talks the talk sometimes but hardly ever walks the walk. His legacy seems to be filled with "Uh guys I don't think this is a good idea" but him doing it anyway. He is very contradictory. But in this instance I'm glad he finally stuck to his word even if it took public outcry and a second chance. Granted far too many voters were calling for his death. But our political climate is at the worst state its ever been in so many seem to have thrown rationale and morals out the door just like the president. McCain only has a few months left and I think he's starting to come to terms with it. Finally doing what he thinks instead of what his buddies tell him to. I hope it's the case. ,
This is pretty fantastic news.  After a year of just feeling like utter shit at the political climate this was something that actually feels good.  I actually woke up read the news and feel....happy.  However there are still many things that need to be fixed in the ACA.  We need lower prescription drug prices we need to do something to help those in the middle class that don't qualify for subsidies and we need to somehow make states want to expand the Medicaid exemption.  Here is to hoping more than those three Senators are willing to work with democrats to do something to help us.,
I'd be happier if people stopped treating McCain like he's some hero for this.The man still wants to repeal the ACA despite his own terminal illness and the millions of others just like him who rely on it.  He would have happily voted for a replacement bill if they actually had one instead of literally voting to break the spine of our current system by ripping out the individual mandate and then worrying about everything else later.  All he's doing here is displaying a modicum of common sense and responsibility but he gets to saunter into the chamber and pause before casting his vote like he's in his own movie about himself and then receive accolades from everyone like a rock star as though he's done some selfless thing out of concern for vulnerable American citizens.It's frankly quite disgusting that a single senator would be willing to vote in favor of an as-of-yet-unwritten replacement let alone all Republicans but 3.  If Congress were actually capable of working on major legislation ahead of a distant impending deadline we wouldn't have a doomsday fight over a budget crisis and government shutdown every other year.,
Clarification:No liberal on this sub actually liked John McCain to begin with. Sure whenever his name pops up in a thread there will be two or three McCain apologists but for every one of them there are always a much larger crowd who remembers 2008.The attempt to find hypocrisy here is laughable and an obvious attempt to distract from the fact that the GOP is an abject and miserable failure of a governing body. They had seven years and every branch of the government on their side and they still fucked it up. It's almost a more historic failure then HRC's two bids for president. ,
I am disheartened by Mccain as anyone here but....tonight his "disturbance" was manifest into a tangible vote. I know this is grandstanding however finallllllly a vote that refelcts his statements. The fissures are amassing and we have so little to turn our gaze from the abyss but this is one of those small moments. Maybe he was a sacrificial lamb due to his condition; however I for the 3rd time in Sen. Mccains tenure I support him tonight. Blah blah blah Ill die if the preexisting/max lifetime benefits go back to pre 2008. Fuck me I made shitty choices as a teen but there are countless out there who may get a decade or 5 more with thier loved ones that are given a momentary reprieve to hopelessness. I love you all. I hope that whatever the ACA has done for you stays in contrast to the hallmark of our previously misguided policy of: fuck the poor. I love you hug your family hug a stranger; I am alive today because of the ada. We can all agree that health insurance is not: bad shit happened now I need some like fire insurance; it is a fundamental right that shouldn't even be referred to as such. Insurance is: bad shit happened I paid moneys so things will be ok. Human compassion is not insurance: you're going to die we as a 1rst world(most prosperous nation on the planet) got you fam. Unfortunately doctors and private researchers can no longer reap obcene profits. Tis the real tragedy me thinks. My 300k meds for my liver cost just about 700 usd in india I think maybe we might be some sort of hamster and our "wheel" is getting us.... nowhere,
i fucking hate republicans and pretty much everything they stand for as a native of a highly successful socialist country how can i not? this McCain guy is really something  tho. il let Thor and Odin know to hold a spot ready for you in Valhalla buddy! il even dig up your body fly you over the "pond" and put you on a viking ship in the fjords and light that bad boy up! This is a fucking Hero! a warrior of the truest meaning of the word! and good for him! how dear you Trump?? you draft dodging little bitch! speak il of a man that actually sacrificed something while you where playing golf and being a corrupt spoiled little piss faced shit!  All HAIL McCAIN!!!,
My initial response to this was to cheer and say "Hah get stuffed" to the Republicans for losing this one but that's not what happened here.This is precisely the sort of collaboration that McCain spoke about in his speech. Democrats and Republicans worked together to defeat a measure that was an unequivocal disaster for the American people. Yes a lot of Republicans voted in favor of this measure but if it had been a vote purely along party lines the ACA would be dead right now.We don't owe gratitude to the Republican Senators who crossed the line. You don't get gratitude for doing your job. But we should appreciate the political capital that behaving like mature human beings has cost them and definitely support further collaboration in the future.,
Thank goodness. This would of have been a nightmare. For sooo many people. Regardless of the repercussions though...it seams that even though the democrats lost and were hard pressed to appeal to their base while find support from other groups the GOP is having something short of an identity crisis. It's like some of them identify with this disgusting hate filled ideal but other times they realize they must champion some form of social or economic justice. Yet they will fight toooth and nail with no humility to try to counter a democrat. Like their playing for a team.Politics isn't a one team on one team game. If you play it that way we all lose. The opposing team is only ever in justice and democratic governmental failure. YOU senators represent a state. If their ideals change either resign or change your ideals. We vote for you guys to vote with us not use us. ,
Thank the Gods I don't believe in. As someone who has gone through cancer treatment for the past two years I can't tell you how terrifying this is that something like this even was considered.Trump and the hardcore conservatives can do the third-grade playground retorts and claim that: "No Obamacare (ACA) kills people... not our bills!" But the reality is that what they proposed LITERALLY would have killed so many people. What happens to people with life threatening illnesses like I had when they are either kicked off their insurance or simply CANNOT afford it anymore? Within the insane inflated health insurance/hospital pricing market of the USA I'll probably have 1.5 million worth of billed-to-insurance costs when everything is said and done. You think the government/hospitals/insurance corporations would pay that for me out of the kindness of their hearts? Hell no. I'd just die or get treatments that don't actually solve my problem.I'm doing much better at the moment. This bill even existing shows that not only does the USA need an actual complete revamp of health care but that Republicans are absolutely not the ones to create that revamp. They literally would rather remove coverage for millions of people out of spite rather than work on fixing and amending policies that are already there.The Republican party needs to not exist anymore. It's no longer a mild "conservative" methodology of governing but instead a haven for the most depraved narcissistic and greedy politicians and sycophants out there. I've never seen such a lack of empathy for the people they are supposed to be working for.,
538 had a live chat on the vote and they mentioned that while McCain is considered more liberal than the average conservative by 93% of Republican policy people his voting record shows that he votes with the GOP 85% of the time. I've personally considered him someone who talks about being a maverick a lot more than he actually is one but he surprised me here. It seems that the breaking point for him here was that there was no guarantee that the bill they would have passed *wouldn't* be taken up & passed by the House if a compromise bill in a House/ Senate conference couldn't be passed. The real key question here is...what happens now? Do Republicans stick with trying to pass an Obamacare repeal? Do they finally move on to other issues passing a budget or tax reform? So far they have tried three different versions of the bill in the last day. Their first bill  which significantly changed ACA by cutting Medicaid  & subsidies significantly failed. Their second bill which just fully repealed ACA and left the problem for a Future Congress to figure out also failed.Finally now their last bill which tried to change a very small (yet highly significant) part of ACA and failed yet again it seems like they will either go even more narrow on the next bill to focus solely on the individual mandate and maybe replace that with allowing insurance companies to charge higher costs for a year for someone who lapsed on insurance or they will finally give up. Personally I think this Congress is so dysfunctional with such bad leadership (*cough* Paul Ryan) that they may well decide to just keep banging their heads against this wall. I sure hope I'm wrong. ,
ugh. here's what we need. forget the single payer. Establish a nation wide public non profit insurance provider. They will operate in all states without limitations. Any and all employers can choose this insurance company as opposed to a private for profit insurance companies. any individuals can buy this public insurance companies' plans also. Any revenues above the operating cost from the premium payments from the patients will go into a national pool to be shared by all localities. And then compete directly against the for profit medical insurance industry for patientswe won't have to wait more than a decade before for profit medical insurance industry dies and goes away. and we will have the best medical care in the world. and the most efficicent. ,
As much as this republican bill was a joke and needed to be defeated it's still sad that our government as a whole is so entirely ineffective at fixing Americas problems. I find it amusing that health insurance rates were predicted to rise by 20% had the republican bill passed when I literally received that dreaded letter just 2 weeks ago stating my insurance will be going up exactly 20%! How is that even allowed? This happen to anyone else recently? Since it seems more likely we'll be staying under the Obamacare system it's obvious it needs fixing yet we have a clueless and vindictive president and a majority party that's completely void of ideas. Bleh,
McCain is as cynical as they come. He's canny he has the best marketing of all Senators being a "maverick" while voting the party line 95+% of the time consistently voting against civil rights labor rights consumer protection siding with big business like a fanatic... he's no maverick.And this is a self-serving vote. It's the right one but make no mistake it serves his interests. Trump is under investigation he clearly doesn't return loyalty to non-family members the repeal is overwhelmingly opposed by the public and he has long been a GOP politician who can pull centrist Democrats which likely would stop after this (if it didn't utterly dry up after Palin... this might be his way to get that back). He's probably sensing the wind is against Trump so this is his way of getting out in front of it. Again I agree with that if true but he's not suddenly a good guy.A guy like McCain doesn't do this without it serving himself first.,
Good.  Never has there been so much hate and disregard for the people of this country.  It's sad that everyone has become so divided and partisan and buy into the propaganda of each so easily.  So many republicans don't realize how much they benefit from ACA.  #Ever hear the phrase "All you have is your health?"Well it's true so why are there people that don't want to make sure they are as healthy as possible all the time.  ACA should be upgraded to single payer system like all the other top tier countries in the world we somehow think we're better than.  Stop fooling ourselves try caring for yourselves for once.  Forget everyone else do this for YOU.  Support single payer healthcare.,
I hope the folks who were literally wishing death upon McCain and saying they would piss on his grave are happy. Some of the comments I read on here were simply disgusting wishing harm upon anyone is just despicable and is never acceptable. That being said I didn't like his previous votes and he did waste the chance to end this nonsense sooner which was reprehensible to be sure but now he finally did the right thing and redeemed himself. It's never too late to do good. He'll likely go back to being "deeply disturbed" next week but today he may have saved thousands or even millions of lives and he definitely gets a lot of credit for that.,
I don't trust this result at all. I think it was all political charades.The GOP at least those in the Senate didn't want this bill to pass. They knew that the ramifications and fallout from it would be political suicide for them. But they also couldn't just not pass it. That would be similar suicide in having to face their constituents. So what they decided to do was purposefully pick out the members that are the "mavericks" (McCain) and those in swing states that need to pretend to be moderate anyways (Murkowski and Collins) and had them vote no. That would be enough people to make sure the bill failed. Meanwhile the rest of them could vote yes on it and use that as backing for saying they did the right thing. Then they could blame the ones who voted no for it failing (and blaming the Republicans in swing states would only be more beneficial to said Republicans since it would ensure they stay in their moderate seats). In short it was all political theater purposefully concocted to give them the best chance of staying in their well-paid and lobbied positions.,
This needs to be said:A lot of liberal democrats lost their minds when McCain voted to move forward on **discussion.**It seems that even democrats are unwilling to debate.Both sides wanted a "my way or the highway" approach to this bill and there was a lot of name calling to accompany that. Things got very personal very quickly.Those of you who derided McCain on his vote to proceed need to realize that you're just as much of the problem as those who want things their way or nothing at all. If you are celebrating this vote and you declared McCain some sort of traitor; I'd really like you to take a hard look at what you're doing to the discourse in this country.,
To think that we were 1 vote away from having a law passed that would've stripped health insurance from millions of people for all the wrong reasons. The GOP has shown daily how much empathy they lack profoundly these past 6 months so it's such a beautiful relief to see them fail so miserably in their attempt to strengthen their oligarchy. Work together you hacks. It's been half a year and all your unpopular pieces of legislation have been struck down by the real American people you represent so please stop with your bullshit stop acting in a childish partisan way or gtfo and let the efforts of lawmakers that want to strengthen this country begin; you've already wasted so much time going back to the 80s in the name of (false) conservatism.,
You lost me at "sampling from an unbiased sample set." Maybe you know what you're talking about but it sounds like you're just pretending to know what you're talking about.You don't know they are politically motivated. You don't know them ... or maybe you do know them. I don't know you. Regardless anyone sane should be politically motivated against Trump. Unless they "sanely" want to watch it all tumble down. Or they are getting something out of the situation. I was responding to the thread. Geez. I just made a statement. It had very little opinion in it. You could argue my assessment that it was far from subjective is an opinion. Sure. But I mean what's your point? I didn't draw a conclusion. I wasn't making an argument. Your rebuttal to thin air doesn't hold any intellectual integrity but thanks for your consideration. ,
American politics is too tumultuous to continue to be observed by outsiders. One moment people are advocating for death then they want to venerate someone as a saint. It all dwells in the extremities and hatred is perpetuated as ardency republicans despises democrats and democrats find republicans abhorrent. Shouldn't politics be more nuanced? Everything impertinent to the narrative is downvoted.I don't believe the majority of people who post on this sub or the other reprehensible sub are adults. Still it's excellent news that Americans have some way to mitigate the healthcare costs a triumph for the poor and working class families. If my understanding of American politics is correct it will be much more difficult to repel now as they require an even greater majority. And perhaps someone found a modicum of integrity and compassion for those less fortunate than himself.,
McCain comes through in the end to play hero?What a fucking guy.John Mav were you just playing everyone before?Did you just want to drag this out to make it look possible and then snatch victory from Trump's jaws? I fucking love it. Yesterday the guy is tweeting you calling you a hero for flying back for the vote. He's thinking he's so close to passing healthcare that he knows nothing about and he'll get to say he defeated Obamacare and you get to take that from him.You embarrassed him on the biggest bill yet. Big ups Johnny! You let him have it.,
The more I've thought about it the more I think this is actually the best case scenario for the Republicans.  Its not like they wanted to actually repeal Obamacare (well some of them sure but there are others who wouldn't want this political albatross around their neck) but this way the status quo is preserved McConnell can continue his BS about how the Democrats aren't interested in actual reform and McCain comes off as the hero of the hour bolstering his Maverick reputation as if trying to shut up everyone who has said "well McCain has said this is awful but he won't do anything about it".,
Heh everyone's cheering him.Really smart on the Republican side. Most of the other votes in the last few days have been lopsided with more than a few Republicans siding with Democrats against ACA "changes". The Skinny was even worse than the others and it got less backlash? Yeah right. Guess they figured since they couldn't get the votes they'd need to pass it they'd at least repair McCain's optics by giving him the 51st vote.Yeah this is "wild" speculation and even if it's true it's probably not able to likely ever be proven.And before anyone says of course I'm happy it didn't get passed.,
Reddit with their partisan boner once again rejoices over the fact that a failed "healthcare" system can remain intact people can keep paying out the ass for things they don't need under threat by the state and politicians can keep stroking their dicks over doing nothing of use at all but getting paid in the millions.Great day for leftists as always.Healthcare became a problem when the state got involved. Obamacare got more state involvement less freedom of choice and more gun to the head do as we say or else type of systematic redistribution.Then Trump tries to push for a little more free market options in this entire mess and of course Reddit the leftist stronghold of delusion rejoices when the RINOs in the RNC keep anything good from passing.But in the end only one healthcare bill is a good one: one that says "stop forcing people into anything authoritarian politicians" would be perfect.,
Concerning the 23 million that would go uninsured:Those are troubling numbers for sure but misleading given the Blue Cross news. If we stay with Obamacare within a few years tens of millions will have no insurance at all that is even remotely affordable. Aetna Humana and other major insurers in just recent months have fled Obamacare. The Titanic has hit the iceberg and it is rapidly sinking yet the left and the media keep fiddling on the deck. They act as though this can be fixed with “minor reforms” but there aren’t enough bandages in America to stitch this back together.Mr. Trump is supposedly the villain because he won’t force families to buy insurance that they can’t possibly afford given the massive premium hikes that Mr. Obama promised would never happen. This is rich.by the end of the year we could have nearly half the country without insurers if this spiral continues.,
This is exactly what I wanted as a Trump supporter. This means we will NOT get watered down Obamacare lite. This means we will get the hardest possible repeal. This means Trump will implement what was his plan all along. He always said "let it implode". He will stop enforcing the mandate and the penalty. Meaning people will no longer be forced to buy into the rigged insurance scheme. Meaning the last remaining insurers will leave the market. Meaning there will simply be NO INSURANCE. PERIOD. There will be a truly free market. Pay cash. Get service. Nothing else.Look at his latest tweet.>3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning let ObamaCare implode then deal. Watch!Yeah. that's right. WATCH! Because he is about to unleash hell. A month from now the dems will pray to god to turn back time so they can vote yes on the bill that just failed. BUT THERE WILL BE NO MORE MERCY. THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE,
Suddenly a german style annexation of power doesn't seem so foreign anymore huh? Don't forget that a large proportion of americans still stand behind their beloved DON. I don't want to attack any one personally just a reminder that no country is "evil" in any sense of the word. If a small snowball begins to roll down a hill in the right conditions it's going to be huge unstoppable snowrock very quickly. I wish you the best my fellow american humans and may the empathy in all of you prevail at last! Don't let some greedy wannabe-emperors ruin what you build with sweat blood and tears. We (the germans) learned through our whole time in school about fascism propaganda and what leads people to follow a misguiding pseudo-hero... and you learn short and quick that germans are nazis. :/ Maybe this whole scenario gives some of you (who are maybe not the most critical thinkers) a little perspective. Be aware! The next tyrant is always waiting just around the corner...,
I hate the GOP and this bullshit they keep trying to do. But in the 1890's if Ford would have asked the public what they wanted a faster horse or a new wheeled mechanical thing they would have responded with "a faster horse". That's why we have a representative government not a straight democracy. It's part of what makes our government work .... well use to anyway. I feel the same way as you. But if we're going to see our way through this we need to hold our selves and our arguments to a higher standard.*Words. Clarity of thought.,
> Americans are outraged by the last minute closed door sweetheart deals that were made to gain the slimmest margin for the passage of a bill that is all about *their* healthcare. - Sen. Mitch McConnell 12/22/09> *They're* pulling out all the stops. *They're* doing everything *they* can to jam this bill through. And *they* don't even seem to care any more about how ugly it all looks. - Sen. Mitch McConnell 03/15/10> This is an incredibly unpopular bill thus *their* only rallying cry "make history". Ignore the American people what an act of arrogance! 'Why don't you all just all you American people all 300 million of you just sit down shut up sit down we'll do it for you. We'll restructure 1/6 of the American economy. We know what's best for you.' This is an act of total arrogance. - Sen. Mitch McConnell 12/05/09I got the quotes from [Seth Meyers](https://youtu.be/BD91AOD4XCk?t=10m) last night.edit:formatting,
Probably not for a while. I believe this bill was a budget reconciliation which only requires a simple majority. They couldn't pass that so they may try to make better plans for the bill. Seeing how some of the Republican senators thought that this bill went both too far and not far enough they probably can't do so.This was the only time they could try to pull this one and seeing how a party can't pass a bill with all parts of the legislative government their approval ratings probably got hit a few points.EDIT: Reconciliation votes can happen only once per year according to Wikipedia. If they want to try again this year they need 60 votes and are subject to filibusters. McCain saved our asses by letting this get to vote and saying no.,
Republicans have so far failed to repeal and replace Obamacare as they promised. The fight to repeal will definitely continue into the future. Democrats on the other hand seem to be moving left on the healthcare issue. Many are now calling for a single payer system.Single payer is not the solution because it's just too expensive. Countries running such systems are struggling with the financial burden and increasingly passing the cost to patients.I recently read a new book titled "On the principles of Social Gravity" by Tobore Tobore. It examined the U.S. healthcare system and came with some very interesting solutions. I seriously recommend this book. It discusses the criminal justice system social security and many other systems in America.For healthcare it proposes the use of cooperatives. These cooperatives will own the hospitals and clinics that their members use. They will be for the people and by the people. The book also argued for cooperatives to move some services overseas to bring down cost. I advise everyone interested in healthcare reform to read this book its the definitely worth it.,
You know this makes a lot of sense especially in the bigger scheme of things.Put it this way.  The GOP was never going to pass that bill.  They knew that a week ago.  They knew that a year ago.  Eric Cantor was on the news just last night saying nobody ever actually planned to repeal Obamacare ever.  So they needed 3 votes.  Murkowski and Collins are easy they've been against it the whole time.  So they needed one more vote to ensure it never passed.  Anybody could do it but they needed somewhere that it makes sense.In comes McCain fresh off the scathing news reports for voting against it and sinking "Trumpcare" that he's been threatening people with for months.  It's surely going to provoke a Trump response and not a good one.  Given the Senate seems more vocal as of late against Trump it might just show Trump attacking McCain just giving the Senate more ammunition to use against this administration and finally throw Trump under the bus.,
This was a good vote it was a brave vote it's what he should have done and he deserves praise for it. That doesn't mean the "McCain is very disturbed" meme isn't valid. He's still the man who launched Sarah Palin from complete obscurity to the national spotlight he still voted to confirm some of the most incompetent presidential appointments in American history and he still has a trend of wringing his hands over "disturbing" legislation that he's about to vote to pass.  People are nuanced. McCain has been disappointing lately but today he really came through. Given that I don't know him personally I can't say for certain but I would guess he's an overall good person who disagrees with me on most things and follows a party that is sometimes at odds with his personal values. I wish he'd follow up his "disturbing" comments with no votes more often but I'm sure he has his reasons whether I'd agree with them or not. ,
I honestly wonder how McCain feels about Trump after all of this.  I assume Trump and his cronies laid the flattery on to get him to come back to DC for this vote.  For what? Basically nothing. They all wasted his time and he obviously could be doing chemotherapy to try to stay alive.  And the next time they get stuck (which very well could be next week) will McCain fly back to DC again?  Or will he just say fuck this guy he's not going to get anything done anyway.  Based on what various people said after his diagnosis was public his prognosis is pretty grim.  So in a very real sense he might have to make choices between his own life and what Trump wants him to do.,
To be honest all he wanted is the normal routine of debate and argumentation on a bill before he could vote on it not this half assed and rushed bill that had no real forethought.  He wanted the process of feedback from the Dems from medical experts from tax experts all to weigh in on the bill before he voted for it..... a process like with Obamacare could take weeks or months.  He doesn't like Obamacare any more or less than any other Republican and given the proper time to write a bill would vote "yes" on something that many here would not like.   Which is why I don't get why people got so furious with him on the vote to proceed?  He stated that he wanted a return to order and to debate the bill.. The motion is normally a formality..  He stood by his words on every other vote by voting negative on each version that was put up over the last couple of days. ,
Enzi is a complete douche.  Both he and John Barrasso are from WY.  Most Wyoming hospitals would qualify as "rural" and receive federal funds in order to continue to operate.  Because of sparse rural populations these hospitals would not exist without federal dollars.  So what do the two Senators from WY do?  Spearhead the bill to take federal dollars out of Wyoming and rip healthcare from their constituents.  Barrasso is even a fucking doctor and he does this!  But the worst part....most of Wyoming fucking loves them for it because the "equality" state is full of individuals that are some combination of ignorant racist and/or bigotted asshats.  ,
Was pretty amazing to see honestly. Senate votes are virtually always known before hand let alone on one as major and contested as this one. McCain was the one that was the most in question. The democratic senators literally erupted in cheers when he walked in the senate floor and gave a thumbs down. He really deserves respect for this one. Especially seeing as he won't get a lot of it from the right.Having the former GOP leader flipping to vote against his party for the other side is an amazing moment in itself. Having the man that did it being the War-Hero Maverick who just got diagnosed with brain cancer and flew in a week after brain surgery to cast the deciding vote makes this one for the history books.,
Hear hear! I am disheartened by Mccain as anyone here but....tonight his "disturbance" was manifested into a vote. I know this is grandstanding however finallllllly a vote that refelcts his statements. The fissures are amassing and we have so little to turn our gaze from the abyss but this is one of those small moments. Maybe he was a sacrificial lamb due to his condition; however I for the 3rd time in Sen. Mccains tenure I support him tonight. Blah blah blah Ill die if the preexisting/max lifetime benefits go back to pre 2008. Fuck me I made shitty choices as a teen but there are countless out there who may get a decade or 5 more with thier loved ones that are given a momentary reprieve to hopelessness. I love you all. I hope that whatever the ACA has done for you stays in contrast to the hallmark of our previously misguided policy of: fuck the poor. I love you hug your family hug a stranger; I am alive today because of the ada. We can all agree that health insurance is not: bad shit happened now I need some like fire insurance; it is a fundamental right that shouldn't even be referred to as such. Insurance is: bad shit happened I paid moneys so things will be ok. Human compassion is not insurance: you're going to die we as a 1rst world(most prosperous nation on the planet) got you fam. Unfortunately doctors and private researchers can no longer reap obcene profits. Tis the real tragedy me thinks. My 300k meds for my liver cost just about 700 usd in india I think maybe we might be some sort of hamster and our "wheel" is getting us.... nowhere,
The most telling thing when you compare McConnell and Schumer's speeches is that McConnell spent all his speaking time either facing straight ahead or with his back to the Democrats. Even while he was talking about how they were nothing but obstructionists and how he was 'very interested' to hear what their ideas were he was pointedly not looking at a single one of them. Even in this short excerpt from Schumer's speech he's looking straight at McConnell. He is not intimidated by the bullshit slander against him and his party and he's not afraid to let McConnell know that. Even in defeat McConnell is demonstrating his cowardice. And most R supporters will call it defiance. ,
As an Alaskan leftist I've come to respect her. I don't agree with her on a lot of things but I think she's sensible. Doesn't come off as one of those monolithic Republicans who refuse to live outside the 1950s. She didn't initially support gay marriage but came to openly support it. She's also broken rank on Planned Parenthood DADT and hate crime legislation for trans people. She's doesn't seem adverse to evolving her views and breaking with her party when they conflict with those views.Basically she's a Republican from a time before Republicans had fully gone off the deep end. She's an actual politician. I can appreciate that. It's a low bar but I'll recognise it.,
To quote what I said elsewhere:>Plus Murkowski lost her 2010 Primary to a Tea Party candidate but came back & beat him in the General with a fucking **write-in** campaign. >>And not only that but she just won another 6 year term JUST LAST YEAR so she doesn't have to worry about the next midterm or Presidential election coming up.>>Idk what Trump was thinking trying to bully & embaress her. There's little leverage from that angle because she's pretty secure electorally. Plus even ignoring votes that come down to the wire as a 3-term 18-year Senator *(she was appointed to fill a vacancy for the first 2 years)* who chairs the Senate Energy Committee she's a powerful enemy to make.           ,
This doesn't mean we can relax. In fact it is the exact opposite. We need to watch the administration like never before. If the administration moves to defund the subsidies low-income people can get it doesn't matter if the law is still in place. Those people are still going to lose their insurance. Even people who *can* afford the plans are going to feel it as insurance companies pull out or jack up premiums to (more) obscene levels.Just because they failed to repeal it from the books doesn't mean they can't dynamite the bridge and collapse the whole damn thing on itself.,
they brought in pence with the full motorcade and entourage to break the tie they fully expected this to pass.  Mccain cut things short they were going around for the vote and that man was probably tired and knew people were outside protesting and had enough. He just walked in interrupted raised his hand said NO right in front of the turtle's face and walked away. Lets end the shenanigans and lets get everyone to bed. Shady shit to pass such important legislature that no one has been able to read literally at all in the dead of night after only a few hours of being able to review it and zero debate.  Trash.,
> The road forward is either Single Payer or to make ObamaCare fixed.Color me skeptical but this failed by three votes. If it failed by 20 30 or more then yeah I'd agree with you. But it's 3 votes. The GOP can come out with a new bill that appeases those 3 GOP senators and it passes. Then they pass another bill with a few more repeals and it passes again.Is there a "number of tries" rule before they just can't anymore? Why is this the only road forward now? Don't get me wrong I'd love to have Single Payer or at least a better insurance net but I think we're still a long ways away from saying it's the only road left.,
The ACA was always pretty terrible because its central operating principle is trying to force insurance companies to be something less than insanely profitable. You can't legislate compassion onto an amoral system. The ACA is going to fail all by itself.The only question left is whether we're going to try to preserve the moronic status quo that lets insurance companies prey on both patients and hospitals or do what the rest of the first world has been doing for decades and actually try to take care of people without making a bunch of executives and stock brokers rich at the same time. ,
> More important we need to keep arguing to get this incapable admin out of office. It may be that we need to press congress to keep Bob Mueller on the job there is currently a law composed by Senator Graham to prevent Trump from firing Mueller.Thankfully the general consensus seems to be that nobody wants Mueller fired. And the Committee overseeing the Russian investigation said that if he was fired they'd just rehire him as an independent counsel. And in my opinion Mueller isn't dumb so he has an exit strategy. If he's fired I bet a lot of juicy news and lawsuits will come pouring in.> The democrats are reaching out to work through these things.The problem here will be Trump. He does not want to be seen as someone who goes to them for help. He wants them to come to him for help as if he was going to be the beacon of light in this whole ordeal. Trump would rather jeopardize his country rather than showing some humbleness.,
But McCain who took so much flak for voting to debate it along with two others voted no and stopped it from happening.  Not only that but they have to get 60 votes if they put it through again.  He had this planned all along.  Not only does it take the repeal off the table for now but failing in this spectacular fashion is way more demoralizing and way more likely to get a rise out of Trump than a failure would have at the last vote.  I think this is done for now.  I hope we can look back and call this a victory without Trump weaseling his way into pushing it again.,
> I'm British and I must say I'm confused. Why are the Republicans forcing votes they know will most likely be embarrassing defeats?This was a very close vote and decided by one vote on the Republican side. They made promise after promise that they would at Repeal & Replace. For the time being all they could promise was a vote which everyone knew would be very close. They were hoping to buy more time with this vote (keep in mind they have had 7+ years to come up with a plan). Normally if the controlling party knows a bill will be defeated they will not bring it to the floor unless it is something symbolic. Oddly enough the Republicans made many of these symbolic bills against Obamacare when Obama was in office knowing it would not pass. Now that they have control they can't agree on what to do. ,
No. They pretty much had to vote on it tonight. There is a limited time for debate during reconciliation bills until it gets to the vote-o-rama. During the vote-o-rama there are no filibusters possible and ammendments are scheduled and dispatched with quickly. McConnell took a gamble rather than submit the bill he wanted at the start of the 20 hours he waited till the vote-o-rama (possibly to avoid an embarrassing CBO score or organized phone banking/protests). The downside to this strategy is that once the vote was scheduled there wasn't much turning back. McConnell tried to convince them that the bill would never become law but was just a vehicle to get to conference with the House so it didn't really matter what was in the bill. In the end McCain didn't trust that Ryan wouldn't just bring up the Senate bill for a vote in the House. I think McConnell hoped once it was do or die time the pressure to not fail would convince wavering R's to fall in line (and it worked for a couple of them). Once the amendment was printed they submitted it for a vote. Once they saw the writing on the wall they were able to delay the vote a bit by keeping the previous vote open for a long time while they lobbied McCain but they couldn't easily take it back at that point. ,
obamacare cant be fixed it ruins marketplaces just by being - replacing it with a obamacare lite which slightly favors republican ideas will do nothing eitherthe left want to go more obamacare and force government to control more of the market until private market is essentially dead - thats what obamacare is but right now its killing the market slowly and those suckers who still have private insurance and like to have choices (middle class) are the ones who have to pay with jacked up costs because there is basically no competition in places nowsome poor may have obamacare but services are getting worse all around - health is dragging down america and it doesnt have to if we allowed markets and worked WITH markets to help the exceptional cases rather than against it,
Two days ago McCain spoke about how bad the bill was then voted yes horrifying Reddit. But his yes vote was not for the bill but yes to bring it to the floor for debate.Last night he voted no on the actual bill.Think about it. If he had voted no on the issue of debate that bill would still be haunting the halls of congress with the GOP doing everything in its power to get it passed. Was the no vote last night a death sentence? No it can still be revived. But the floor vote was a pretty strong nail in its coffin.,
No but I think most of the people bashing McCain (including myself) took his vote from a couple of days ago out of context. See that vote was to open this bill for debate and discussion. It could have been killed right there but that would have left the matter open for further voting down the line. Basically nothing would have prevented them from trying again in a couple of weeks. McCain voted "Yes" to allowing the bill to go forward. Depending on how you want to look at it he did it for one of two reasons. One he genuinely wanted a debate and a conversation about this bill and voted "No" tonight because that debate didn't happen. Or two he knew that if he voted "No" a few days ago they'd just try again. So he allowed it to go through and then voted "No" tonight so that it would be truly dead. Basically he's either much more genuine than most of us thought much more politically canny and tricky than most of us thought or both. Basically he pulled a fast one on the vast majority of us. A lot of people myself included were expecting him to vote with the rest of his party tonight but he didn't. ,
He voted "yes" as to whether they should debate the subject at all and then take an actual vote on it.  Had he voted no on that then it wouldn't have even been able to come up for an actual vote.  But when it came to the actual vote tonight he voted "no."So some were upset that he allowed a vote to proceed at all.OTOH you could say that he wanted their to be an actual debate on the subject so they could decide on it's merits.Basically he helped load the gun but then wouldn't let them fire it.,
He always said that the senate needs to go back to normal order. Maybe he saw it would never happen this way with his own party in the majority filibustering questions until the actual vote so that there could be no discussion from either side. They had the votes and had no need to do that. Plus the house lifted rules to make fast tracking the bill easier after assuring that it wouldn't get through in its current form.Frankly McConnell is an absolutely shit majority leader. He gambled and won as minority leader but he's failed at everything but the easiest of tasks (like approving a SCJ) and even those he gave up minority party rights for. He's leading a majority like a minority party ,
Republicans in the Senate had 20 hours to come up with a bill to repeal and replace the ACA. Once the deadline hit they realized their best shot was the "skinny repeal" where they didn't actually change that many parts of the ACA. The goal was to get 50 votes because here if the senate is tied the Vice President gets to cast the tie-breaking vote.  They had to vote on it and only got 49 votes so the skinny repeal so it failed.The point was to get anything passed because in the American legislature when the House and Senate pas different versions of the same bill it gets resolved in a conference between leaders of each. So the Republicans could've totally changed the bill to whatever they wanted and Democrats couldn't stop them. ,
Who do you work for?  I bet if you boiled it down it's the people that pay you and the people that can fire you.  If you aren't the owner you work for your company as best you can and you follow your boss' directions.  If you own your own business and there is some conflict between customer needs you typically end up supporting the one that spends more or is more likely to spend more in the future.We aren't on either list for most of our reps and senators.  Their job expenses are paid by campaign donors.  Their party affiliation relative to their district lines or state largely guarantee their reelection.  If you aren't paying them and you can't fire them why the hell should they care about you?,
Honestly I only said that because I had absolutely no faith that the Republican Party would do what was right for the American people. And I was primarily right to be honest. The GOP overwhelmingly voted for a shit bill that would end up killing people just to save face politically. This wasn't "my way or the highway" for Dems because we aren't in control. In fact we simply wanted there to be actual debate actually taking the bill into the committees and working in a bipartisan manner. With hearings. Having witnesses from the actual healthcare industry involved. Not having a bill that has only 17% approval with the people. The GOP wasn't interested and now they've shit the bed. They deserve every second of this because you reap what you sow.,
Because he flip flopped basically. A few days ago he was critiquing the substance of the bills put forth as well as the shady way they had been put forth thus far. Despite all his big words he voted to proceed on this bill anyway. Naturally people called him a hypocrite.Then early this morning he voted against the bill flip flopping again. This time the flip flop is to the benefit of the American people but he has a history of flip flopping against them as well.Furthermore by making his decision secret and saving it to the last minute he turned a process that had literal lives hanging in the balance into a political circus (IIRC he literally called it a show) that made him look like a hero all the while avoiding the kind of political pressure and threats that the other two no votes have been receiving for weeks for being upfront about their misgivings about the bill.TLDR In American politics people tend not to like flip floppers.,
Basically this bill wasn't supposed to be the total overhaul of healthcare/Obamacare that they promised. It was designed to just get their foot in the door so that both houses of Congress would sit down together and come up with something that actually worked since pretty much everyone agreed that this bill as it was written would not. From Lindsey Graham a Republican senator: >“The skinny bill as policy is a disaster. The skinny bill as a replacement for Obamacare is a fraud. The skinny bill is a vehicle to getting conference to find a replacement.” 3 Senators ultimately decided that the assurances of cooperation and good faith negotiations weren't enough and voted against it. 2 of them were expected but the third (John McCain) was a surprise to a LOT of people. I'm less certain about this part so don't take it as absolute truth but from what I understand this is the end of Republican efforts to pass a bill through the Senate with only 50 votes (plus the tie-breaker from the Vice President). Any further bills regarding this will need an actual 60 vote majority to go through. Again I'm not entirely certain of that and I'm definitely open to being corrected if I'm incorrect. ,
Not anymore. The GOP was trying to pass this through budget reconciliation so they would only need a simple majority.  As I understand the process (someone please correct me if I'm wrong) you can only attempt budget reconciliation measures once a year on one topic per year and under certain circumstances. Since that ship has sailed any other health care reform measures will need 60 votes to pass or else it will be filibustered by Democrats. Meaning the GOP would either need to get rid of the filibuster once and for all (possible but unlikely) or actually work with Democrats to come up with a bipartisan solution (somehow even more unlikely).,
Yea I live in one of those countries. It's great. I also grew up in America and became an adult before Obamacare existed. The system right now isn't good. The system could be a whole lot better. But without Obamacare the anarchy health system that we used to have is much worse. Many people want a system like you and I have and many people are fighting for that. But until there's enough votes for that keeping Obamacare....well it's not winning the fight exactly it's just that it's not losing it. And with how hard they fought that feels pretty good right now.,

Can't expect a subreddit of 3 million+ people to be all homogenous in their opinion now can ya.  Haha.I still think the people celebrating McCain for being a hero for what he did today are a bit misguided but infinitely more civil and decent than the ones who practically rejoiced at his diagnosis.  His vote helped to block the bill which I'm glad for but it does not make him a hero in the political sphere because as Stannis so elegantly put it "A good act does not wash out the bad nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward."However he IS a hero for volunteering to fight for his country and should be shown respect for attempting to continue to serve his country.  The people who are celebrating him as a hero today are a little caught up in the surprise of his vote and praising him a little more than he deserves (although anybody who doesn't think it would've taken some massive balls to vote against party lines like that is fooling themselves).  The people who were celebrating his cancer though?  The ones who were happy he was going to die?  They are the worst type of human being and the shittiest type of partisan scum.,
No it's not. And I'm tired of hearing it.  This isn't a game for everyone some people in politics are actually doing their job for the people. Even some of us commenting are genuinely concerned for our country not just playing an us versus them game. He just happens to be a Senator who puts his constituents before his party he's done that for his entire career. He genuinely wants to repeal Obamacare but not without the right replacement. He said basically that in his Tweet this morning.  The ability to seriously speculate that it's all out of spite is what Trump and McConnell have brought us to I suppose. That's the climate they've brought us.,
> I think repeal of individual penalty if not the mandate & the employer requirement could have workedIt wouldn't have worked. People would just... not get insurance. Then once they got sick (or pregnant) they'd sign up for insurance. And if we're still making insurance companies accept everyone (even those with pre-existing conditions) then that brand-new "pre-existing condition" they got a week ago would still need to be covered. Basically forcing companies to cover pre-existing conditions but not having an individual mandate leads to people simply not getting insurance until they need it... which leads to insurance companies going bankrupt. ,
You are aware that there's millions upon millions of redditors right?  I never said anything about McCain myself other than sympathy for what he's going through on Facebook.  He's one of the few republicans I give a shred of respect to.  I think he mostly just follows his party and does what he's told but he's had moments like this where he votes with his conscious.    Going through the comments I see a lot of people essentially saying the same damned thing.  They don't love him or anything.  They just recognize that he voted with his conscious one last time.   They respect that at the very least.,
He's not a hero. I've been his constituent for all of the years I've lived here and he's held no stop to fucking over the entirety of Arizona (I have since moved to Massachusetts). He's a liar who only cares about stuffing his pockets and the interests of rich people. You really think he voted for this because he cares about the people it effects? If that was true he wouldn't have voted for the last 500 repeal efforts the GOP have tried to force through. He's in it to save face before he passes away because he knows if he voted yes his legacy would be a shitstain. ,
Healthcare became a problem when the greedy found every way possible to profit off of it and exploit people.Now because of all those brainwashed to fight for capitalism against their own best interests and because our government has a whole lot of people with big insurance and big pharma in their pockets we can't have single payer like most of the rest of the first world.Government is what we the people are supposed to have control over to fight abuse. We've been abused badly by big insurance for decades and people are dying over it. You want to strip all that power away we want to fight. Obamacare wasn't perfect because it was the conservative plan but it's a start and should be built on not torn apart so 16 million people get kicked off big insurance gets richer premiums keep skyrocketing anyway and our economy tanks. All so republicans can say they got rid of Obamacare. This effects real people it's not a game wake up.,
The problem isn't Obamacare and it never was about it.  The problem is the idea that healthcare is an industry entitled to unlimited profit and the Hospitals can charge any amount for services to cover the collusion in pricing drives up premiums.  The "industry" incentive is to reduce costs (sick people) and maximize profits (through premiums) and no one wants to deal with that part.  Finally the second underlying problem is the collusion of big pharma to allow restrictions on price negotiation.  Obamacare isn't the problem but it was a solution hampered by Republicans preventing all the necessary components to work better.  Meanwhile it is not Obamacare or ACA as it really is called but the ability of the Insurance companies to raise premiums with bunk excuses. They hate Obamacare because it highlighted a different approach which threatened their little goldmine of death.You can thank Nixon for our problems...https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transcript_of_taped_conversation_between_President_Richard_Nixon_and_John_D._Ehrlichman_(1971)_that_led_to_the_HMO_act_of_1973:,
It's better than before. You may not think so but many others do. I am one of them. I can't afford healthcare either but I see that Obamacare was a step in the right direction. BOTH parties need to come together and finally settle healthcare as the human issue that it is. Not a partisan issue. Not an American issue. Healthcare is a human issue. BOTH parties need to put VAST amounts of pressure on the insurance industry to fucking get in line and stop fucking everything up.What I really don't understand is why no one is talking about how the insurance providers are the ones making everyone's lives hell. Everyone hates the insurance industry and yet we don't force them to lower premiums in at least some way? We just allow them and the medical industry to reap the benefits of people who are dying? How does that make any sense? Business markets are not untouchable. Treating them that way gets us into this fucking situation we are in right now (just like what happened with the banking and housing industries and is also happening in nearly every other industry out there over the last few decades).,
Do you know how expensive your healthcare would be if the ACA was never passed?  The ACA actually slowed the rate of increase. http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-obamacare-premiums-20160726-snap-story.html>An important new study by Loren Adler and Paul Ginsburg of the Brookings Institution adds another key factor. Their finding is that even with an expected spike in premium increases for 2017 rates are still lower than they would have been without the Affordable Care Act. **They calculate that premiums would have to rise by more than 44% for next year to approach where they would have been given the pre-ACA trend line**. In fact Adler and Ginsburg are being conservative — they calculated a rise of 5% a year from pre-ACA rates even though the actual annual increases ranged from 11.7% in 2010 to 7-8% in 2011-2013.,
When someone threatens to take away health care from my wife which allows her to get up every day go to work and function normally I get very angry. I'm glad McCain voted against this but it doesn't change the fact that he voted for a repeal and replace bill that by all accounts would have been even more destructive than this. It also doesn't change the fact that if I'm choosing between my loved ones and the life of a man who wants to take away what they need to live normally (like my wife) or live at all (like my grandmothers) I'll choose them every time. I won't feel good about it perhaps but there will be one less old man in the world. ,
You do realize that nothing that republicans were trying to pass was going to reduce your premiums. The last "skinny" bill they were trying to pass was going to raise your premium by at least 20% in 2018. And yes cost of insurance is absurd in this country because cost of medical care is absurd. You may not have used your insurance for 3 years but all it takes is one slip and fall or a sudden unexplained pain in your abdomen and you might be looking at bills of 100 thousand dollars. The insurance is there to protect you from total ruin. That's where the real problem is and nobody in the country... not republicans not democrats or anybody has an idea how to fix that. Certainly not any of the republican bills they've put forward so far.,
Wow you really think this is all about winning and not doing what's best for the country? They voted against this because it was a shit bill that was almost unanimously hated. Republicans even admitted it was a bad bill and they were doing it "just get something done". They did their job and voted their conscience and put country before party. They realized that this bill is awful and just because you promised to repeal and replace the ACA doesn't mean you have to replace it with shitYou know I hope you don't come out and vote because you are what is wrong with the American voters. Please stay in ,
>  Pay cash. Get service.I don't disagree that most insurance schemes are a scam but I don't know too many people that have tens of thousands of dollars on hand to drop if they need a surgery. Not to mention my diabetic sister would have to spend thousands of dollars per month for her supplies out of pocket. Without insurance she wouldn't last the year.> He always said "let it implode".But is it really the ACA failing on its own if the president *actively* sabotages it? By not enforcing the mandate and penalty as well as refusing to pay subsidies for the low-income it's obvious it would fail because no one is following the law. It would be like if police officers stopped pulling people over for running red lights and stop signs then wondering why there are so many more accidents and screaming that the "law" doesn't work.Yes rates have been increasing under the ACA but people forget that rates were climbing *faster* without it. Not to mention if you actually wanted health insurance you had to be in perfect health.> This means we will get the hardest possible repeal[They tried that too and it failed with even more votes then the "skinny" repeal.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/senate-rejects-repealing-obamacare-without-replacement-trump.html) They had 3 different votes with various levels of repeal. All 3 failed.,
"Just saying if he was smart like me I'm one of the smartest the smartest President ever not like loser McCain or like crooked Hillary who sent great clean coal jobs away from this country with Obama clean coal... think about that... the jobs... they're all gone and it's because of people like crooked Hillary... and the failing New York Times says that I colluded with Russia... There was no collusion. I've been to Russia great country beautiful women everywhere and Vladimir Putin... who they say I colluded with...I had never met Vladimir Putin before my meeting this month... He told me in 2016 that he respected me and was going to help with the election. That's how much respect he has for me. And let me tell you if Jeff Sessions had told me he was going to recuse himself then I wouldn't have hired him. Wouldn't have hired him. I would have said "You're fired" before I hired him. Because I'm the most smart... that's how I made my money by being smart.... Smarter than anyone else smarter than John McCain who is let me tell you not smart because this guy he calls himself a war hero c'mon a war hero. I have known guys who are war heroes great guys like John McCain who served this country when the Democrats were trying to tear down all the things that Frederick Douglass built during his great presidency but you see he's dumb. He's got brain cancer... cancer in his brain. Now tell me how do you claim to be so smart and then get brain cancer? I don't get it.",
I am ashamed I voted McCain in 08 because my number 1 concern was closing gitmo. Number 2 was a president who actually gave a fuck about veterans. I hated Palin but took it on the chin as something he had to do like super pacs. It was weird back then but not as bat shit off the wall idiotically insane as it is now.  I wasn't republican or Democrat. I was just ashamed of what was going on with those 2 issues. And I still think he could have and would have fixed those. . But now it's such a shit show.  I do not understand why people vote for a president who makes cruel tweets at 3am. . I do not get it,
I wouldn't be surprised if the fact that he could die very shortly also impacted his decision.  This vote is something that will actually be remembered and in the long run will probably be viewed as a good thing.  Whereas providing the decisive vote for a health plan everyone (even the Republicans!) hated...  not such a great thing.I mean otherwise why take the risk of coming all the way there right after surgery only to vote no?  He wants to be remembered for this.And I mean what is Trump going to do to him?  Threaten to oppose his re-election?,
It's a solid argument on it's face. He is on some serious prescription drugs was diagnosed with brain cancer (*which the public is not entirely informed on the severity of or stage of*) and is deciding policy that is critical to the entire country. Arguments like these are used in courts all the time. There *is* an argument to be made here if they really go that route.I *highly highly doubt* they will open that can of worms. Most likely Republicans will reluctantly work across the isle with Democrats to craft some kind of bi-partisan fix. This is what's needed most and frankly is in the best interest of the country in my humble opinion.We do live in interesting times don't we?,
Don't people get it? He probably decided his substantive vote before his motion to proceed vote. He tactically decided it'd make more of a statement to let them debate it then defeat it rather than refuse it on a procedural vote. I think the trouble a lot of people are having is separating his views from his integrity. I disagree with most of his views but the core things tested by the Trump administration are integrity not political issues: this was a question of country or party and even his worst enemies would have to admit for McCain it's always going to be country. ,
> when the news hit about his cancer everyone was saying how much of a great guy he is and classy.This is because of a tendency to treat people with cancer with kid gloves.  No one wants to be that asshole who is kicking the guy with cancer.  People were sort of shocked into being nice.> Then seemingly the next day everyone was saying they will be happy when he is dead.People remembered what his actual Senate voting record was like and what his policy positions were.  They also realized that he was voting to keep the Republican plan to kill the ACA alive.  With this vote he managed to stop the  partial ACA repeal for the moment and keep a lot of people from losing healthcare which is great.  However it may well be that he did so because it didn't actually repeal the ACA completely.  So he might have done a good thing for all the wrong reasons.,
My parents are super strong supporters of Enzi because being the smallest (population) state they believe that they need someone to handle things "the Wyoming way". He advocates against anything besides military that involves the federal government so that Wyoming can do its own thing... Or something. Idk I can't wait to see what they have to say about this tomorrow.SPIN UPDATE:Me: "Mike Enzi filibustered away all of the time that was allocated for debating the bill last night." Them: "Oh..."They did not seem pleased but ultimately seemed uninterested. They may or may not try to find a reason after work today but I apologize for the lackluster update.,
I know this was a joke but I resent the fact that McCain's vote on this issue may be characterized as payback. McCain 100% did not oppose this bill for the same reason I and many people did. He has been and still is a staunch critic of Obamacare. He opposed the process by which the GOP was trying to push through repeal without proper evaluation and debate. I don't think any less of him for voting the way he did for the reason he did. I feel like attributing his vote to revenge gives him a lot less credit than he's due:,
This is the moment. Can't wait to see Ed Harris play this moment in the climax of the McCain biopic in a few years.EDIT: It will start with McCain being a little flustered as he prepares for the Comey testimony. He knows that the pressure will be on as the world is watching. His time for questions finally comes but McCain struggles his words coming out all wrong.As people start to talk about his performance he gets the sense that people are avoiding saying what they want to say - McCain is losing his faculties. His staff cover for him but he privately starts to doubt his worth in the Senate worried that maybe people are right. This is a stressful time and perhaps he is declining. In the face of Trump a man who has insulted and demeaned him it's a disappointing end for a proud man.McCain resolves to finish his term and the furore dies down. Weeks later he goes home and discovers constituents are harassing him about healthcare which he agrees needs addressing urgently. Governor Ducey admits it's going to be a tough vote but they both expect Heller will buckle and save McCain from having to make a stand against his party.Then his symptoms worsen and he's taken to hospital. A clot behind his eye needs to be taken out and he's given the very best service and the utmost respect. One day in recovery he walks through the hospital and sees people that are newly covered under Obamacare and is newly conflicted.He meets a terminal patient named Diane being visited by their family. She's delighted and stoic and hugging her grandchildren. Later in the night he sees Diane crying in the garden. He goes to comfort her and she says that she only cries at night by herself. She wants to be brave for her family but it's hard. She finds it easy to keep asking herself "how do you want to be remembered?" Then she can stay strong and be a loving grandmother until the end. They part ways her wishing him the best for whatever tough times may lay ahead. The doctors tell him he has brain cancer he discusses it with his family and they choose to announce it publicly. The outpouring of love and respect from the public and old colleagues is overwhelming - he's not used to pity or having his private life aired like this.In the middle of dealing with this he's asked by McConnell to come back to the Senate. His family is concerned but the defer to his choice - he goes back. He's not sure how he's going to vote but McConnell is counting on his yes.He enters the Senate to a standing ovation but he's again uncomfortable with such a focus on him. He wants to get to work and he gives a speech saying as much. It's powerful but he tanks all that goodwill by voting yes to proceed. His earnest speech is met with skepticism by his opponents who have seen him pay lip service to opposing Trump far too many times to believe it. McCain privately reiterates that he expects Heller or another senator to vote against the bill so he won't have to. McCain says that he will take the advice of Arizona Governor Ducey who refuses to take a stand. John is on his own.Repeal goes to the vote McCain standing in the Senate until the early hours of the morning stitches over his eye watching at his colleagues surround and badger Collins and Murkowski. They hold firm. It's only when Heller says Yes that McCain figures out it really will be up to him.He's finally approached by McConnell who says this is what they've fought for and they need to deliver for their constituents. He tells John that this will be their legacy and they need to deliver on their promise. He asks John a simple question: "how do you want to be remembered?"Diane's words echoing in his ears he sits alone. They call names and hear votes. Finally he stands. Heads swivel to him Democrats across the aisle stand to see over to him. He walks to the front and lifts an arm ready to vote."No."He drops his arm a small smattering of applause throughout the room as he moves back to sit next to Murkowski.The motion fails and McCain gives a small nod. He may not have led a perfect life but today he did the right thing.,
McCain isn't a fucking maverick and he never has been. This scenario is a good example of his transparency. He knew he was going to vote no. He could have voted no days ago but he didn't because he created a media circus around himself. That way he could rise from the ashes to vote no and "save us all". The media will eat it up. But in reality he let that garbage go to the floor where it was a real threat to thousands so that he could get attention. He's manipulated the narrative in this way his entire career. He's rarely ever actually bucked the party. Meanwhile the disabled activists that have been protesting day and night for weeks being arrested and detained in humiliating ways ripped from their wheelchairs - they're the ones who put in the work.  They're the ones who made this tangible for so many. But John McCain saved us that's what they're saying. That's how they'll tell it. ,
Well he did vote in favor of the first repeal and replace vote that would have kicked 20+ million off of insurance--a vote that only took place because of his initial vote to move forward. I respect his vote tonight but the vast majority of his votes falling in line with the rest of the GOP and Trump kind of ruins any chance of him being a real maverick.It's pretty amusing watching the Reddit pendulum swing between the extremes on McCain over the past couple of months.McCain expresses concern about something Trump does."Yeah go McCain!"McCain votes in line with Trump and the GOP anyway."Fuck McCain!"McCain diagnosed with cancer."McCain's a hero and great man!"McCain flies across the country to cast the deciding vote to move forward with repeal votes."Fuck McCain!"McCain votes in favor of one repeal bill and against two others one of which he is the deciding vote on."McCain's amazing again!",
It does not need to be repealed because healthcare before the ACA was absolute shit. If you can't afford it now chances are you couldn't have even *qualified* for it before. The ACA is flawed yes. Part of that is because it genuinely has some design flaws that can be fixed if the GOP will finally give up on their vendetta and work with the Democrats. (The other part is because the GOP has from day 1 been trying to and sometimes succeeding at sabotaging the ACA so that they can justify their vendetta against it. So I'm not inclined to buy their narrative about it and I'm not inclined to reward them for their behavior.),
> But his first vote was what got us here in the first place. I don't think we should just be patting himself on the back now.If he had voted no to not let the process continue the bill would have been just been put on hold while they worked on amendments and such.By voting to move it forward and then voting no *on the bill itself* he killed the bill.  Thats it.  They can't keep messing with it and trying to force votes again.  Its dead.The first time they could reintroduce is next session(?   next year) but after this humiliation are they really going to want to touch it?His "yes->no" buried the whole thing in the ground.  "No[->no]" would have just put it back in a holding pattern.,
There is a good argument to be made that it was a procedural vote to enable the discussion on the floor and that it was a fair approach to give them that chance. It is rare for politicians to make that distinction (though it happens) and still be a no-vote on the actual bill - in part because if you know it'll die an early death can be a mercy killing -> McConnell sure didn't enjoy losing by one vote with 10 minutes to go. But it is consistent to say I will vote yes on the motion to proceed but then vote no if the bill remains as bad as it is in effect saying "I will give you your chance to make your case to me and others who don't like it as of now but I will vote no in the end if I don't like the bill.",
In the end it's just as sophisticated to be optimistic and disappointed as it is to be cynical and surprised.  I was/am of the later group.  That said I agree.  He did vote consistently to push forward worse bills and to allow this literal brinksmanship to occur.  In the end though the timing of his vote may have actually punished some of the GOP more.    There was a lot more exposure in the way that this played out.  For example Heller literally got caught trying to play both sides of the issue and can't hide behind partisan politics necessity.....and his seat was already at risk for the midterms.  ,
That was the vote to debate it. Failing there wouldn't have had as much impact as this. This was the proverbial stake through the heart. More-so that they voted on a few different versions of repeal and failing all of them.What makes it even sweeter is it was McCain himself who killed it. I want to believe this was his plan all along knowing that he would be the vote that killed it. The entire time he was telling everyone he was in and would vote yes waiting patiently for the moment to strike. Then without warning he drives the dagger into the heart whispering "Shhh. Shhhhh. Shhhhh. It'll be over soon.",
Don't forget Browder's public testimony during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. He confirmed that Putin/Russia was closely tied to the Trump campaign;TL;DR - The Magnitsky Act was implemented in 2012 as an anti-corruption measure against Russian Oligarchs Browder was a key player as a lobbyist for this Act that was essentially sanctions. He operated an investment firm in Russia and he was on a crusade to stop government/business corruption in Russia. His firm was stolen so he hired a lawyer Magnitsky who found a lot more Russian government corruption. Magnitsky the lawyer Mr. Browder had hired was imprisoned and tortured to death. A lot of money is now frozen in the west thanks to the Magnitsky Act. Much of it belongs to those very close to Putin and quite possibly his own money too as Browder estimates he is worth approximately $200 Billion. Trump Jr.'s meeting which included Kushner and Manafort had Russian lawyers that have been fighting against the Magnitsky Act. Remember how they claimed they talked to the Russians about adoptions? Well in retaliation for the passing of the Magnitsky Act the Russian government banned American's from adopting Russian children. This is just unreal. More information can be found here; [Here's a written transcript of the testimony](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/) read Browder's opening statement and he will have you hooked. This isn't some spy novel fiction this is real life and it has happened and is happening. From the article;>The financier Bill Browder has emerged as an unlikely central player in the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. **Sergei Magnitsky an attorney Browder hired to investigate official corruption died in Russian custody in 2009. Congress subsequently imposed sanctions on the officials it held responsible for his death passing the Magnitsky Act in 2012.** Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government retaliated among other ways by suspending American adoptions of Russian children.>**Natalia Veselnitskaya the Russian lawyer who secured a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort was engaged in a campaign for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act and raised the subject of adoptions in that meeting. That’s put the spotlight back on Browder’s long campaign for Kremlin accountability and against corruption—a campaign whose success has irritated Putin and those around him.**The Russian collusion is much bigger than I had previously assumed. It seems to all come back to the [Magnitsky Act](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/magnitsky-act-kremlin/535044/) which passed under Obama that essentially froze Russian Oligarch money; > ...freezes certain Russian officials’ access to the stashes they were keeping in Western banks and real estate and bans their entry to the United States. The reason Russian (and now American) officials keep talking about adoption in the same breath is because of how the Russian side retaliated to the Magnitsky Act in 2012 namely by banning American adoptions of Russian children.  ,
It wouldn't have been put up for a vote unless Mitch thought he had the votes. What that means is that McCain (or the two ladies) had to have lied to him and promised to vote for it. It's that simple. If Mitch didn't have the votes he wouldn't have put it up for a vote. They lied. They 100% lied to their majority leader. Mind you I don't blame them for doing it. Sometimes you have to lie just to see if your leader would really do something so stupid... and when you actually see that he will then you vote against it. But the fact remains Mitch was confident he had 50 votes plus Pence. Mitch was wrong. Someone lied. ,
I'm not sure I 100% agree with your last sentence there (there are absolutely lots of reasonable Republicans and vengeful Dems out there) but you've identified the reason I find gerrymandering so odious. If you've gerrymandered a district to the point where you don't need to be afraid of a challenger you basically have no reason whatsoever to even acknowledge the existence of the people who voted against you. In a balanced district you can't play to the more extreme right or left and have any hope of winning which should ideally moderate your position on a variety of issues and lead to more cooperation in the legislature. However between gerrymandering and the increased concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas that hasn't been happening and we have effectively been rewarding more extremist voices as a result.,
> At a 1982 candidates forum McCain "snapped" to use his own word after somebody brought up his residency "for the thousandth time.">Here is what he said:>"Listen pal. I spent 22 years in the Navy. My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of Arizona but I was doing other things. >**As a matter of fact when I think about it now the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.**">The late Phoenix Gazette political columnist John Kolbe is quoted in Timberg's book as calling McCain's brusque answer "the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I've ever heard."Also:>Mack contacted McCain's former wife Carol in hopes of digging up dirt on McCain. An offended Carol gave McCain a heads-up about the telephone call. (She also discussed the conversation with Kolbe who ripped Mack in a Gazette column.)>McCain confronted Mack after a subsequent campaign event.McCain recounts in his book: "When the debate ended I walked over to the opponent who had attempted to mine some little nasty opposition research from my failed marriage and told him with as much steel as I'm capable of demonstrating **'If you ever try to hurt anyone in my family again I will personally beat the shit out of you.'**"This guy is badass.,
They need to use reconciliation to pass a bill but the window is about to close. There is really no way they have enough time now they are about to go into recess. They also can only pass one reconciliation bill per year meaning that they fucked up their chance this year and they can try again next year but they would have to waste their only bill next year on it instead of what they really wanted which is to pass huge sweeping tax cuts through reconciliation next year. They may still have some tricks up their sleeve I'm not sure but they seem pretty fucked right now. I believe September is the due date for the budget for the next fiscal year and reconciliation is part of the budget process. So I guess there is sort of a "soft number of tries rule" in the sense that you can only try so many times in the year before your time is up. That is how many times they have tried now as far as I can tell.PLUS their real problem is that they are a completely intellectually bankrupt party and they utterly failed to come up with a single idea that would actually make anything better which is why even the vast majority of Republicans hate the bills they have proposed. That is why they failed the extreme unpopularity so passing this was always going to be hugely burdensome to their reputations and frankly after the amount of time the public has been left to think about this and what it will mean for them to do this all over again next year and then pass something extremely unpopular only months before a critical election despite the fact that the provisions they consider most important will cause immediate and extreme negative consequences for their voters is *completely insane*. I think they wanted to do it now not only as a stepping stone towards the major tax cuts they want but because the distance will help people to forget about it more.Maybe they have some evil devious shit planned that I don't know about maybe they will take the brazen disregard for the law and the constitution to the next level somehow and I won't really be that surprised if something like that happens but at this point I also won't be surprised if they just readjust their plans and move on to something else and health care never gets revisited again. Only time will tell.,
He already is sabotaging the ACA! He (and other Republicans) are doing so in several ways but most importantly by simply threatening various policy changes Trump can get what he wants without actually needing to kill the hostage. ["In mid-April several of America’s largest insurance companies descended on Washington to seek the White House’s assurance that Trump’s rhetoric about withholding the subsidies was just a bluff. Seema Verma Trump’s head of Medicare and Medicaid Services informed the insurers that it could be a bluff — if they agreed to publicly support the president’s health-care bill."](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/06/trumps-sabotage-of-obamacare-is-working.html) We've seen insurance company reactions with [various market pull-outs](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-anthem-pullout-20170606-story.html) and rate adjustments already. The idea that the ACA is collapsing on it's own is just another big lie one in a long list that Trump's base has fallen for. I was never a fan of the ACA and preferred an efficient market based solution based on the great system in Singapore (such as [this proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4VpAFwBu2fUYk5aV3Rud3NsUTg/view) from a conservative think tank). It's been absolutely disgusting to see the dishonest tactics Trump has used to get a system that's every bit as inefficient as the ACA passed. Trump and McConnell have ruined the one chance we had for a plan that fit with conservative American values of freedom of choice and limited government. Instead these idiots whether they pass some other version of their crappy plan or not have paved the way for single-payer all while poisoning half the country with lies to divide us even further. Fuck them.,
This is complicated a little.Single payer would mean that we all have insurance paid from our tax dollars and can see any doctor or hospital at any time. And pay NOTHING when we do.ObamaCare is similar in ways but involves insurance companies taking our money instead of taxes through the government. In addition since those insurance companies get the money they get to decide what hospitals and doctors we can see. Also the insurance companies get to make a profit whereas the government would not. Which means we would and do pay a copay or more money as opposed to paying ZERO under Single Payer.This is a VERY simplified version and someone else can surely explain it better.,
ObamaCare is a subsidized multi-payer system where the government mandates the minimum coverages necessary provides premium subsidies for the poor and some degree of premium regulation and provides an insurance marketplace but insurance is still provided by multiple private entities (insurance companies). You pay your insurance company the insurance company pays the doctor. Prices for both premiums and services are set more or less by the market. The profit margins made by the insurance companies are regulated.In its essence a single-payer system is just what it sounds like; there's only one "insurance company". It's nominally a branch of the federal (or state) government. You pay the government the government pays the doctor. Because there's only one payer (the government) that payer has the ultimate authority to set prices for healthcare services so price setting is a typical component of single-payer. That is to say the government tells providers how much they can receive for specific services. Single-payer does not necessarily mean that all healthcare services are free to patients and paid through taxes but that's often the case. However there's no reason you couldn't still retain a copay or coinsurance or pay a premium with a single-payer system.There are many components of healthcare and a lot is assumed when you bring up single-payer but really it's just that; the risk pooling is provided by the government at cost. This is actually quite important because medical billing overhead from the multi-payer system is an enormous source of waste. If you look at why our healthcare is so expensive administrative overhead from multi-payer is the single largest contributor of waste although far from the only one. ,
McCain voted "yes" on bringing this health care vote to Reconciliation which is basically a once-per-year option to revise a bill that brings the vote threshold from 60 (filibuster-proof) to 50 (simple majority with Pence casting the affirmative deciding vote) and also to bring the bill to the floor for debate and a final vote.  In spite of his public condemnation for the bill (much like Sen. Graham from SC) McCain voted "yes" on every step of the process to get us to this point--up until tonight of course when he voted "no" on the bill itself.  This was unexpected from the left as the expected outcome was something more like what Sen. Graham did who said quote>"I'm not going to vote for a bill that is terrible policy and politics just to get something done"And >“The skinny bill as policy is a disaster as a replacement for Obamacare it is a fraud.”And then voted yes on the bill itself anyway.,
I don't think much right now can be called too much credit.12 hours ago people were shitting all over McCain for his vote to continue the debate despite him explicitly saying he would not vote for this bill. They all said he'd go back on his word that he was a traitor that he was destroying America and that his legacy would be tied to that decision.Well... look what happened. He said he would do something and he did it. He knew Collins and Murkowski wouldn't vote for the bill and he knew the bill wouldn't pass without his vote.,
But you did and that's enough.  You can't expect to every thought you send into the ether of the internet to become some glistening pearl of knowledge embraced by everyone you want it to reach.  You just throw in your two cents hope that someone finds it interesting amusing or even fucking wrong as shit and keep an open mind as they expand on it draw from it or best of all challenge you on it.  Hope my dumb ass made someone step back and look at themselves even if just for a sec.  But hey if no one does 'least I've got you to talk to eh?  =P,
I'm as left-wing as they come but I at least understand where the religious right is coming from.Jesus said "There will be poor always".  God has decreed that some people are poor.  Perhaps they're being punished perhaps they don't have the faith and determination to do well.  You can't intercede to help these people all you can do is step back (and roll back regulations) and allow them to help themselves if they can.As for LGBTQ those are perversions explicitly called out in the Old Testament.  We shouldn't be helping these people we should be stoning them to death.That's how the hard-right Republicans think.  They have religious-based reasons to hate gays and to ignore the poor.  It's a sad philosophy but some people swear by it.,
The private market is shit and fundamentally flawed by itself you dipshit. It was failing long before the ACA. It had no solution for the elderly before Medicare. Either open up a federal funded health network that has it's own clinics and hospitals across this nation that provide basic and   catastrophic care for a heavily subsidized and accessible price for all; Medicare insurance for all; or expand private market high risk pool subsidies and get the States agree to Medicaid expansion. Pass one of those or you get nothing. Once the market ensures it will not deny others and be inaccessible to many then we can start working towards deregulation. ,

Yeah but now they must be feeling a new level of shame this morning. It was obvious from the beginning that they were willing to vote on *anything* just to say they got something done. They only failed because of 1 person. If they put together a bill that isnt complete garbage as was the case last night McCain will no doubt vote for it. Dont believe for a second that Murkowski wont fold next time around either.The only one that seems to be a solid No is Collins (which is not enough). Rand could be a thorn in their side if the bill isnt horrible enough but he will fall in line after a concession or two,
Medicaid was on the chopping block for the new plan that was to be created during the skinny repeal.  Both hashed out plans for the GOP included cutting 600-800 billion from that which mostly goes to people that fall through the cracks (sick old or new babies). Side note medicaid is really an investment in not having blight around due to medical pricing carnage. The reason so many babies are born on medicaid isn't because people are not able to pay it is that pricing is so out of wack in fixed chargemasters at hospitals due to insurance companies interference that anyone that happens to lose insurance or has weak insurance during that they fall into pricing oblivion. The cost of having a baby for just the delivery is up around 15k with no complications then there is prenatal and postnatal care. Births with any complications can go up to 300k+. An average healthy birth with all care can easily run 30k with no issues. ,
> Honestly I only said that because I had absolutely no faith that the Republican Party would do what was right for the American people.Your reasons are your own and people like me will have to accept it; however the party mentality that this statement encompasses is a large part of the problem and certainly leaves quite a bit of wiggle room for things like this vote to occur and blindside you.>This wasn't "my way or the highway" for Dems because we aren't in control.I'll have to disagree with this. All 48 Democrats voted "no" on every single bill. Just because they're not in power does not ensure that they are not being obstinate. edit: A controversial double negative,
Actually he voted yes on the motion to proceed gave an impassioned speech about the need for deliberation and regular order stating unequivocally that he would not vote for the bill as it was at that moment then voted yes on the first bill which was the Senate repeal and replace he had just said was unacceptable.He did vote no on the other 2 that followed but people were frustrated with what they saw as his hypocrisy. I was too but the level of shittiness about it was ridiculous. Ultimately they all knew the first one wouldn't pass but he voted "no" where it mattered this time. ,
I understand that whatever republicans have in mind is worse.I just wish that liberals in America visited other countries for once in their life and witnessed what normal good healtcare looks like. The ACA is **ABSOLUTELY NOT** a step in the right direction its completely fucking backwards and off to the side. You can't 'fix' something so inherently flawed that it fines people for not using it and only survives from gigantic government funding and bailouts of insurance companies. No country on Earth has ever witnessed a healthcare system as bad as Obamacare. I'm not saying that countries with absolutely no healthcare are better but they don't go around parading themselves as a 'legacy achievement' of a president which to everyone else in the world is a blight on Obamas presidency.It really is like 1984 when the government told the population to be happy and grateful that the government has increased the chocolate ration from 15 grams to 10 grams. That's how ass backwards americans seem being happy about saving the worst system on earth.,
Democrats should be tearing down Obamacare and fighting for universal health care. There is a lot of support for it yet they keep thinking Obamacare is not the worst health care system on earth that's where they are wrong.Even if there is little to no chance of universal health care being introduced in USA for a decade or more that is no excuse to being content with $1000/month insurance costs. So many appropriate analogies come to mind.You could have a kid going to school and their mum gives them a sandwich with rusty nails in it when they complain the mum goes 'Well at least its not cyanide pills!' and the kid is OK with it. That's democrats defending Obamacare.,
I know it was terrible.This is the reality of the situation;You used to be the worst-ranked country in healthcare for decades before Obamacare.After Obamacare you are still the worst ranked country in healthcare and it is getting worse as time goes on. It's still better than it was but it is literally moving backwards towards how bad it was beforehand.It has clearly failed.Democrats should be clamouring to devise a brand new health care plan but they're not. They keep pushing Obamacare despite it being the worst system on Earth. Democrats should repeal it and start from scratch with a new system. I have never once said the republican plan (or lack of one) is better than ACA but **something** needs to change and 'fixing' will never get you to the ideal single-payer system. If health insurance in America is a building that has collapsed under its own weight you don't 'fix' it by throwing money at the rubble you bulldoze it and start again this time making sure its actually strong enough.,
Your system is screwed because you've been fed a turd sandwich and told to appreciate it or else you'll starve to death and you all pat each other on the back going "Wow we're so progressive! We have a health care system devised by Obama! We're not racist!"The democrats shafting Sanders was the biggest fucking mistake they've made in who knows how many decades. Not just for them but for America in general. You all had your chance to end the cartel of drug companies toying with your lives but here you are cheering on those same scumbags who sentenced you to this hell.It truly is pathetic seeing the 'resist' crowd being good little peasants and doing exactly what the insurance companies want them to do.,
You see politics as Team A vs Team B...except that's not what it should be.  We are *one* team - with an offense and defense.  Both want to be the ones to win the game (against the world) and both think they are the ones that have the best plan do it.  Being pissed at McCain is like being pissed when your CB lets the other teams receiver score a TD but then cheering him when he makes an interception the next series.  No one switched sides he's just just a defensive player who redeemed himself to people who think you win games with your offense.,
Costs haven't been kept down & ACA did not address costs in anyway to existing rates increases prior - the increases have kept up. Maybe the states can work in tandem with ACA to bring costs down in their states if the federal government won't do it. I am not for the penalty because first the market isn't fair as it's exorbitantly pricey so I don't think penalizing people who can't afford the higher costs is right. The health insurance as a necessity is also a major problem the arbitrary cost of care is another issue all of these problems stem from insurance industry practices in collusion with hospitals. I really don't get why people just ignore these sorts of inequities when they know it's harming them. ,
I used to pay about $230 for medical and dental and have 20 chiro visits allowed each year. This was for a medium level plan. I figured health coverage would increase and I'm fine with that and I don't mind subsidizing for elderly and poor people but now I pay $300 for only medical and I literally can not use it unless I get into some horrific accident. Recently I felt like my calf exploded so I wanted to use my insurance because the pain was horrible but I was smart enough to call to see what it would cost me. Minimum $900 for office visit and MRI . They said to try acupuncture lol. Which actually worked but still ,
I for one value the integrity of the process of the senate over short-minded thinking based on positive or negative consequences. I'm not so zealous that I take it as a betrayal whenever someone who dares to disagree with me motions to follow the proper political process. Proper debate is essential to politics (even if you think that debate was a sham the process must be respected) and the senate must have he right to examine the bill. Undermining the political framework for short-term gain seems beyond idiotic.Yes he still disagrees with me on politics. Your point? Presidential is an adjective describing rational level-headed respectful and knowledgeable individuals who are able to communicate their beliefs with clarity and appropriate levels of vigour. Men or women with a firm grasp of the political system the nature of politics and the responsibility of his station. It has nothing to do with political beliefs; slaveowners are some of the most poignant examples of presidential figures in history. I do not like what McCain stands for. I would never vote or him. But he deserves respect as most principled actors - who genuinely believe in the process as a force for good - should. I don't write him off because he dares to disagree with me I'm not so dogmatic. Indeed his consistent history of calling for bi-partisan action in the chamber of the senate is impressive.That's how you build bridges and secure progress. Not with vitriol and petty insults.,
A short term increase is acceptable if a long term solution plays out.  Especially considering that I'm likely looking at far more than a 20% increase next year anyway. My plan went up over 60% last year alone. I will have paid almost $10000 for coverage this year and it only covered a doctor once for an annual checkup.  All other visits are on us as we'll never hit our deductible and my free GoodRx app gives me a %40 cheaper rate on meds than Blue Cross can negotiate.  This isn't health care. This is extortion. If I have to pay extra in the short term while they burn this to the ground and figure this out then so be it. ,
McConnell once literally filibustered his own proposal that he introduced as a bluff that the Democrats called. He also overrode an Obama veto on a terrible bill then blamed Obama when the effects of the bill finally came to light. He stopped Democrats and Republicans from coming together and giving a unified statement rebuking Russia for meddling in the election while threatening the administration should they attempt to help states and localities identify Russian intrusions into their systems. McConnell is the epitome of the most disgusting aspects of our politics. He's a stain on the history of the Senate and he'll be remembered as an ineffective partisan hack and a disgrace. The damage he's done to the country is immeasurable. /rant,
Yep. If he voted no on the debate he probably would've retired due to health and potentially be replaced by a Republican that would've stuck to the party.There's also the fact that this is a budget reconciliation bill that was voted against. Budget reconciliation bills can only be made once a year and allows a simple 51 majority. If McCain voted against debate we would still have a budget reconciliation bill and only require a 51 majority.Because he voted yes on the debate and no on the bill itself it not only killed this bill but also any chances of a bill like this ever happening this year. If the GOP wants a chance of this bill this year they need a 3/5ths majority now which means talking to the Democrats.,
They own it in reality. It's their power to make it sink or swim. They've already said they'll watch it sink. When it does their base will continue to blame the Democrats. Meanwhile people will die as they lose their ACA in the midst of market collapse. Their inaction won't cost them many votes from their base. Especially because they'll play the "WE TRIED TO REPEAL DISASTROUS OBAMACARE BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE" card. With any hope Democrats can regain some kind of control and fix things before it's too late. If not I'm not sure this will matter much politically. Edit: like clockwork... this just appeared on my city's news Facebook page as the most liked comment: "They just need to let the fiasco known as "Obamacare" implode on itself. Then hold those responsible for shoving it down our throats accountable.",
The new healthcare bill has basically been denounced and criticised by pretty much every big health and insurance company all Democrats and pretty much everyone who depends on healthcare on a regular basis.I get that the Republican idealogy is different than the majority of this web site but it's absurd that people are arguing for repealing the ACA when there is either no replacent or a replacement so bad everyone hates it.You can't trash talk this law for 8 years and then offer nothing in return. McCain and others are doing the right thing by realizing that you can't just get rid of something so vital by offering up a rich people tax cut in return ,
Okay. But let's acknowledge that this was not even close to the standards of the Senate.* A bill to massively restructure the country's health care system was written behind closed doors with zero input from the other party - *or* even most of the ruling party.* The recklessness of the bill on citizens hospitals doctors insurance companies was potentially so destabilizing that the vote just to talk about it - needed the vice president as the tie breaker.* Let's not forget that at the time of the vote to debate the bill --- there was no bill literally.  That's Alice in Wonderland type stuff.  "What are we debating? You have to vote to debate it to find that out.",
Just for perspective: Trump is *able* to do the right thing. McConnell is *able*. What matters is what they *do*.McCain's track record is to publicly speak for things he then votes against.  This vote while welcome was an outlier in that it does not follow the party line to which he normally bows. It was typical in that it's another action that does not follow through on previous actions (see also the last vote he cast). Am I glad he helped slap down the repeal (note: helped not single-handedly crushed)? Of course. Does that erase McCain's lack of principles? No sorry. No whiplash here. What annoys the fuck out of me (and this part is a response to several users not a reply to a single comment) is the tendency to see this sub as an entity to then smugly comment on "the sub" supposedly "changing its opinion". Except it doesn't work like that because the people who were fucking angry at McCain are not the same people who now think he's a saint. The rational middle is still "eh McCain's gonna McCain. No surprises there".If you want a monolithic sub where only users with a single opinion are allowed or a sub where users really and demonstrably engage in hypocrisy there are plenty of those. This is not one of them.,
Again who is this "we" you speak of? Do you think the people whose comments you are complaining about are the same people?Before this vote I thought of McCain as an unprincipled flag in his party's wind (ew).After this vote I think of McCain as an unprincipled flag in his party' wind. Still ew.Am I grateful he helped? Yes. Do I still think that overall he's an unreliable ally? Yes. Has my opinion of McCain changed? Not much.In a public forum you will always get the most comments about things which make people most surprised and emotional. Before the vote the people who hated McCain's guts were out in force. Now it's the people who are more inclined to see his antics as a sign of character (see overuse of 'Maverick' at the moment).They're not the same. There is no "The_Politics". There are different people who are more or less vocal depending on the current situation.,
This selling across state lines is a bunch of bullshit. They say it brings about competition no it doesn't. They said the same thing about banks and credit cards in the 1980's.  There used to be regulations limiting the number of branches a bank could have and they were limited to where they could be located. That was changed and all the banks went to the states with the most lax banking laws. You got high fees terrible customer service and corrupt banking practices - think Wells Fargo.The exact same thing will happen to healthcare. Right now the insurance companies must comply with patient protections in each state. When the insurance companies screw people your state insurance regulator can get you some relief. If this goes national you have no protection. Second the health insurance industry will have massive consolidation if they sell nationally just like the "Too Big to Fail" banks.  The smaller insurance companies will get swallowed up and that ends customer service and it will raise costs.  It's a terrible idea and it does nothing to help bring down insurance costs.,
I can't imagine McCain needs money anymore.  He's been in congress long enough plus I'm sure whatever sweetheart deals he's made have made him quite rich.  For all that I disagree with McCain on I believe he is doing what he thinks is right (most of the time).I mean for McCain he likely has a much bigger choice than most of his peers in that skipping treatment very well could cost him his life or months to live longer than he wouldn't have had otherwise.  I'd just hate to see McCain spend his last days trying to pander to Trump.,
There are so many villains on the Republican side it's really astounding.First the House was bullied into passing their version of the bill because of guarantees that it couldn't possibly be made into law because everyone acknowledged that nothing that shitty should ever become law.  Now the same thing was going to happen in the Senate.> Before rolling out the new legislation Senate leaders had to deal with a rebellion from Republican senators who demanded ironclad assurances that the legislation would never become law.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/obamacare-partial-repeal-senate-republicans-revolt.html?_r=0WTF are you doing voting for something that is so awful that you need ironclad assurances it would never become law?> “I’m not going to vote for a bill that is terrible policy and horrible politics just because we have to get something done” Mr. Graham said at a news conference calling the stripped-down bill a “disaster” and a “fraud” as a replacement for the health law.And then he voted for it.> Republican senators found themselves in the strange position of hoping their bill would never be approved by the House.WTF are you doing!> Even some senators who voted for the bill Friday conceded that its enactment could have been disastrous. You're literally voting for something that will be disastrous if it's enacted.,
Just cause you keep repeating the lie doesn't mean we will believe it.[http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/ahca-less-public-debate-than-aca/](http://fortune.com/2017/06/27/ahca-less-public-debate-than-aca/)> Much of the process to repeal and replace Obamacare has been opaque with important decisions taking place in private meetings behind closed doors — something Republicans criticized the Democrats for during the creation of the Affordable Care Act.**But looking back these processes aren’t even close to comparable** in terms of transparency.>**Affordable Care Act**>The ACA made it out of committee in the House of Representatives in **July 2009 after a month-long markup and 160 Republican amendments.**>The House didn’t vote on it until **November 7th.**In 2010 the **Senate health committee spent nearly 60 hours over the course of 13 days marking up the legislation** that would become the ACA.>The **Senate Finance Committee held 53 meetings about the ACA** and an eight-day markup of the bill which was the **longest markup for the committee in over 20 years**.

Wyomingite here that's not true. It's like most other places we have plenty of assholes but most people are nice. You also have to realize our economy is heavily dependent on oil and coal so I think that's why our politics swing so far to the right. As much as I dislike Trump and voted against him I am benefiting from him not closing down Coal mines like Hillary wanted to because I'm a real estate agent. Idk if Trump has actually done anything to help them but last year I barely scraped by financially and this year I'm making good money.,
Why? I'm not being an ass here I'd really like to know why you hate how undemocratic the senate is. It is not and never was meant to be *democratic* by any representation. That is what the house is for. If anything the senate is more democratic now than it ever has been. So I'd like to know why you have such a problem with it. Is it out of ignorance? Is it simply because you don't understand the how and the why the federal system operates the way it does? Or is it because you do understand and disagree with the system at large?,
Plus Murkowski lost her 2010 Primary to a Tea Party candidate but came back & beat him in the General with a fucking **write-in** campaign. And not only that but she just won another 6 year term JUST LAST YEAR so she doesn't have to worry about the next midterm or Presidential election coming up.Idk what Trump was thinking trying to bully & embaress her. There's little leverage from that angle because she's pretty secure electorally. Plus even ignoring votes that come down to the wire as a 3-term 18-year Senator *(she was appointed to fill a vacancy for the first 2 years)* who chairs the Senate Energy Committee she's a powerful enemy to make.          ,
I'm gonna love watching Trumpites call for their heads.Collins? Win a primary challenge from the right and Maine is going to punish you with a Democrat/Independent. Senators from Maine have generally been moderate D/R.Murkowski? She already lost a primary once to a challenger from the right said "fuck that I'm *actually* a 'Mama Grizzly Bear'" and won in a *write-in* campaign where the average voter had to remember how to spell Murkowski correctly so the voter didnt get declared invalid by lawyers.McCain? Cancer notwithstanding he wasn't running again anyway. I won't speculate as to his reasons for doing this but I imagine we'll find out soon (sooner if his wife suddenly is no longer considered for an ambassadorship).EDIT: Punctuation.,
> They really don't know how to work with people. When every vote can count pissing off every other senator on a personal level may not be smart strategy.The Senate is broken. There's more broken with Washington but the Senate deserves to be upended.  This single-party win-at-all-costs sign-anything-with-51-votes bullshit has GOT to go. Mitch has failed. He's an absolute and utter failure. We all know what he was trying to do with this vote. He was selling it TO HIS OWN MEMBERS as a blank check that won't be cashed and that a real bill will magically appear in the conference between House and Senate. And we all know how Paul Ryan would treat such a check:  He'd cash it. Immediately. He'd pass the identical legislation and send the bill to Trump for a "win". The Senate needs new leadership. Senate Democrats should be working to find a coalition with moderate Republicans and put a new majority leader. Unfortunately the Senate doesn't work the same way the House does. The Senate's two top positions (other than VP) are the president pro tempore (who is almost universally the member of the majority party who has served the longest) and the majority leader (who must be elected by his party exclusively).  This is very different than Speaker of the House where new coalitions could (in theory) see a coalition between moderate Republicans unite with Democrats to choose a new Speaker and thereby upend the leadership.  This could still happen but the customs and structure of the Senate make it even less likely and the power structure makes it such that even if it happens it'd be pointless. The only way the Senate gets new leadership is if they decide to break custom and choose a president pro tempore (which really wouldn't change much since the majority leader has most of the power) or if the Republican majority somehow fractures in half and chooses a new leader (extremely unlikely when only 3 seem capable of voting anything other than the party decision.)Either way the Senate is fucked and Mitch is an absolute failure. ,
I think his speech probably sums up his true thoughts.  No matter what the bill McConnells process on this one is toxic to the institution and the whole skinny bill shenanigans demonstrates that more clearly than anything else.  Regardless of whether this bill was about senselessly wrecking parts of the healthcare system or giving puppies to orphans killing it to show this process doesn't work is the right thing to do.   I don't see Democratic leadership pulling a stunt like this but if they ever did I'd hope a Bernie or Barney Frank or other long time member would do the same and preserve the institution.  Now let's see if they make the same mistakes on tax reform.,
Dude he was summoned back to DC for that procedural vote so they can bring those shitty proposals to the floor. McCain seems to have only voted yes for the BCRA as I recall but cannot understand why he thought it was better than the skinny one. The guy was a couple of days out from that surgery when Trump robocalled him or something.He got his head cut open to get rid of that tumor and the GOP wants him to vote party line. If they pass it Paul RYan would either create a committee to rework this bill (lols) or pass what was passed by the Senate. It could have been any of those plans - like that game where you have to open a door to see if you get a prize or die because you're poor and have no insurance.,
he voted yes on the debate vote because he believes in a return to "regular order" where before the Rs became obstructionist douche bags in the Obama years there used to never be votes to bring stuff to the floor. the idea being that if a bill was good enough to make it through committee to be considered by the full Senate it should be good enough to at least debate on the floor no questions asked. It was just by tradition but Republicans changed all that under Obama. So he voted for open debate as an attempt to show he wants regular order.a better question is why he voted for full repeal and replace. maybe because he knew it didn't have enough votes to pass or maybe he honestly thought it was the better bill?,
The media and reddit sucked at reporting McCain's stance on this the last few days when he's actually pretty clear on it. He as a republican doesn't like obamacare but he knows both sides aren't working together for the good of the people. So he voted yes a few days ago cause he wants republicans and democrats to work together now that the bill is on the next level. But he will not vote yes on the next level without major changes to the bill and doesn't want to repeal without a replace. He wants both sides to work together for the good of people. His idea of "better" healthcare might not align with yours but I don't think he's rooted in evil. And he's certainly not confused on what he wants to do as shown by this no vote. He just wants both sides to work together cause this thing republicans and democrats are doing sucks. ,
The thing is people were saying the exact same thing about the DeVos approval from Committee.Murkowski was a deciding vote to approve DeVos in committee. She approved to move DeVos to a vote but Murkowski said that DeVos didn't win her vote yet.  Then Murkowski went on to vote No on approving DeVos for Secretary of Education and it was a tie vote that Pence ended up breaking.You could argue that Murkowski could have prevented DeVos from going onto a vote from the beginning but I was not buying the bullshit response of "she deserves to have the senate vote on her".  At the time it all seemed face saving for the Republicans so that her supporters will think that she did something all while they knew they had the 51 votes in the Senate to approve DeVos.I don't know... what the fuck is the whole point of voting to move something forward that you will eventually reject?  I get the point is to debate but if you really want a bill/nomination killed and you have the power to do so why even take it as far as it can go?  The point of these smaller committees and such is to prevent this garbage from making it to a vote,
What would they have talked about in the 2016 elections?  No healthcare plan is perfect they will all have their faults. ACA is pretty revolutionary imo which is a business owner with seven employees who we provide with coverage. Before the ACA premiums were skyrocketing we had to drop out HMO plan which was really nice esp for families. After passage the rates actually went up less than usual and we didn't have to keep raising our EPO deductibles to afford everyone's coverage. The GOP doesn't have a solution.  Their constituents want the ACA and Medicaid. The radicalized primary process encouraged this REPEAL 4 muh FREEDUMS shit which the majority of constituents do not want.,
The fact it took an unpopularity of 85%+ and it was only one vote away from moving along is horrid. For reference it took a super majority of Americans to change 6% of republicans votes and 2 of their states would be utterly devastated.If anything ACA funnels money and levels the play field of rural areas/states which overwhelming vote republican.Ideology over not only country but even your own constitutes well being(Financially and Medically). I know it's not "helpful" to call people out when they are acting dumb...but my god I wish at this point we could just split into 2 countries. Maybe if their base didn't have single issues to vote on and their life was increasingly shit they might be more interested in how/why they are getting fucked so hard now they are in their religious mecca.,
No it's not.McCain has not supported this bill throughout this process.  Any attempt to construe his vote for continued debate as support for the bill itself betrays a lack of knowledge about the process McCain was working with here.If the motion to open debate had failed there would have been very little blocking McConnell from waiting a bit and bringing the bill back up for the very same vote.  By voting to continue debate McCain was not declaring support for the bill but support for *voting on the bill in the near future* at which point he even said in that speech he would not support it.This allowed him to do what he did tonight vote *against the actual bill* which harms the repeal effort *far* more than blocking it on procedure would have.  McCain played this well he deserves respect for how he handled this especially given his medical state at the moment.  You may not agree with most of his views (I don't either) but this was a smart move by him and it helped millions of Americans keep their healthcare.  That is good.,
But he also consistently voted for several bills which were much worse has one of the most consistently predictable GOP ballot histories and despite being so vocal against trump he was close to leading the way on voting for his issues and appointees at a clip over 90%.Everyone had the right to be cynical here and that doesn't change despite how he acted here (though yes it is great to be wrong and a good act is still a good act).  John cast the killing vote on the cliff edge but he helped to drive the car to it.  Sure it took bravery to grab control back on the situation but other people have acted more consistently in this whole months long debacle.  Lets not start ignoring a long history here and forget to give (the greater?) credit due to others like Susan Collins.   John also did not have absolute control of the situation and I feel that taking the risk is irresponsible.  All it would have taken was Lisa Murkowski flipping Pence breaks the tie and it goes to the more to a conference where the more conservative House has all the leverage. I also don't get why the Senate couldn't talk about this healthcare bill or any other version of it in any other sort of normal procedure.  It isn't like this was the only way.... ,
I think you got it right with "saving political capital." Senators come from different states that sometimes have very disparate interests not to mention an individual senator's own agenda. With McCain he's cared most about military and foreign policy (no comment on his views on those things) so he's gonna toe the party-line most of the time to bring issues that he cares about to the floor. Nearly all members of Congress use this modus operandi because it is the only effective way to build capital. The exception are the "principled" ones. They're the ones you see on TV pining for the spotlight.,
The Browder testimony is absolutely as horrifying as it is heartbreaking. And it reveals two things. First the Magnisky Act is a direct middle finger to Vladimir Putin because it a) allows the US to freeze Putin's ill-gotten gains some of which are likely stashed in the US and b) allows the US to freeze his cronies ill-gotten gains in the US. Putin wants that repealed specifically because it makes him weak since his kleptocrats are not happy when they can't keep what they stole. Second it means that when Don Jr. tries to brush away the meeting he had by saying it was innocuously a discussion about Americans adopting Russian babies he's a lying shitcan because the adoption ban was a direct retaliation by Putin for the Magnisky Act.To me Browder's testimony is a smoking gun that makes it clear as if it wasn't already that Don Jr. was ABSOLUTELY talking about removing sanctions against Russia in exchange for help with opposition research on Clinton no matter where it came from.In Trump America only Trump Americans matter. ,
Want to know how all of this is connected to Trump and the GOP? Fusion GPS. Veselnitskaya hired them to dig up dirt on Browder after the sanctions were put in place. We know that Fusion GPS was hired and worked for all 3 sides. The Russians pro-Trump and the anti-Trump side.For the Russians they were releasing fake news reports on Magnitsky that he was not murdered and was actually a criminal. They were also unsuccessful in lobbying Congress to get his named removed from the Magnitsky Act. They definitely broke the law lobbying for the Russians without any disclosure.Fusion GPS hired Steele to investigate the Trump connection because he worked decades for the MI6 in Moscow. The GOP then dropped the firm after Trump won the nomination. The GOP most likely was aware of the Trump-Russian connection but at that point it didn't matter because he was nominated. The Clinton campaign then ended up hiring the firm to complete their research. The GOP then attempted to frame the Clinton campaign accusing them of using foreign oppositional research. This of course was a smokescreen because Steele was not working for any foreign government unlike the arrangement the Kremlin and GOP seemed to share. The Republican party and the Trump campaign have been colluding with the Russians for quite some time.,
> Well in retaliation for the passing of the Magnitsky Act the Russian government banned American's from adopting Russian children. This is an absolutely brutal reaction. Putin has literally taken thousands of children hostage. It's only different from a garden variety psycho who holds his kids at gunpoint in it's larger scale. It adds a different perspective to Trump saying:>[Wouldn't it be great if we actually got along with Russia? Am I wrong in saying that? Wouldn't it be great? O.K.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhSzGp7-OiY)Interestingly Trump said we should get along with the kidnappers 3 weeks after his campaign met with them to negotiate. Frankly I'm surprised he still hasn't tried the tactic: >Won't someone think of those poor Russian children? ,
I mean there is a build in safeguard. You have to vote to proceed to debate(What happened before this vote). Some things require very little analysis or time for debate. If Senate didn't feel ready to debate it should just vote no.I mean...we get the government we vote for and we voted for religious/capitalistic Ideologs.Honestly though I think we are the point where we should just let them break off and do their own thing. All the federal money getting funneled into red states will come back and we can start catching up to the rest of the world on basically agreed upon progressive policies. Or at least I dunno...Debating reality instead of wherever the (R)'s are living now.,
It's 7am here. I literally stayed up all night to keep an eye on this even though I'm a Brit. Even though I've heard that "it's America's own fault you're in this mess". Even though Trump's shenanigans are what gets more coverage. Even though the Mooch has been having a hilarious coke-fuelled meltdown.*Because this is important*. Lack of healthcare kills just as effectively as any tactical nuke. And it's not enough to rail against the tyrant at the helm but it's also important to celebrate subtle victories like this. Because they're victories for empathy and *basic humanity*. We have the NHS here in England which is still chugging along despite the cuts and the red tape and demoralization and we appreciate it even though we bitch and moan about waiting times and lists and the occasional medical or admin fuckup. And those of us who are paying attention have been hoping for this result and are cheering you guys on - because a) we have empathy b) it's a reminder of how bad it could be and c) rather selfishly because *this could happen to us if we stop paying attention*.Well done America. o7,
I know you're joking but the flowchart is backed by knowledgeable people and I'd say experts in the field but I feel that is putting it lightly.They can not pass this same repeal again because it has failed at the one of two stages where you can not simply add amendments to get it back through house to senate floor with one or two changes.  This means that to try and repeal again would require the time and skill to get an entirely new bill through the house then to senate which is very unlikely to happen as the Republican party has now failed one of their **biggest** promises since this whole Healthcare "Repeal" thing became a talking point.Not only has no major bill been passed almost all of these days under the current GOP has seriously killed their middle-ground for people on the left and center and the only people left over there now is people who are simply too far gone to be properly educated on why things like this bill are stupid as hell.Basically:  It's dead for a sizeable while.,
Actually a lot more people died from lack of access to care for chronic conditions before Obamacare. You can't get dialysis at the ER. [Before Obamacare nearly 50000 people died annually due to lack of health coverage.](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/)The healthcare system was **really really bad** in 2009 and while it's only gotten incrementally better that increment represents tens of thousands of deaths annually. The ACA has yet to actually go into full effect (we're looking at 2025 if it survives) but it's led to a reduction of preventable deaths of [at least that amount](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/31/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-health-care-law-has-led-50000-/).Many many more were bankrupted by medical costs; that has its own negative outcomes at the public health level. Personal bankruptcy is firmly associated with negative health outcomes including death.Millions is probably an exaggeration though; these aren't linear trends because health policy tends to change *at least* every century. Tens or even hundreds of thousands though **without a doubt.**,
When He said the poor you will always have with you - it was said in the context of informing His disciples of His impending death. It was not informing Christians to ignore the poor - but rather - the opposite is true.We are to care for the poor as they will be with us always.As for LGBTQ - we are not to judge them as we do not have a full understanding of human sexuality ourselves. It is not for us to determine if "they" are perversions but it is for God to determine. "Matthew 7:1-5 “Judge not that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye’ when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye."James 4:12 "There is only one lawgiver and judge he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?"They have a mighty skewed view of what Christianity is to believe we should ignore the poor and hate others. That simply is not what Jesus taught and died for.,
No the mindset I'm referring to is tribal.If you win the nomination for the republican party to run for the senate in Utah you have already won the seat.  There are some formalities to tie up but barring something truly horrifying you won.  After the last election I don't know what qualifies as sufficiently horrifying but presumably there is SOME way you could lose.The same is true for the vast majority of house districts.  Cook political report lists 69 house seats out of 435 to even consider switching parties and 32 of those are in the 'Likely' column meaning the outcome is very likely already known just based on the partisan shape of the district.  8.5% of house seats have a reasonable chance of changing hands in 2018 according to a well-known expert in such matters.We aren't really picking our congresspeople so while sure we have the power to fire them we don't.  So why should they fear that power?,
In Australia that $200+ per month is for extras (dental massage some forms of gym memberships and exercise classes) and the bits of hospital care that the public health system doesn't cover (i.e. private room cosmetic procedures etc).GP optometrists (though not all of it) hearing actual medical procedures for the most part anything life threatening pretty much all prescribed medication mental health services (well to a limited amount) is all covered by our public health system.I mostly have the coverage I do because I anticipated needing more due to health concerns a few years back.Out of curiosity what does the employer sponsored insurance cover?,
Because there's nothing we can do about it without a reasonable healthcare system. We can't just force hospitals to charge less and everything will be okay.  If you want insurance companies to be able to realistically cover everyone then you need everyone to participate in the market. The reason we have an individual mandate is because conservatives didn't want the government to get into the insurance business (because reasons). In order to make that system work we need to offer reasonable options to people. We don't currently have that because of other problems with the ACA (taxes on medical devices certain provisions that are required of all plans etc) as well as some slimy maneuvering by certain parties.   Everyone agrees that these are issues with the ACA but there are disagreements as to what kind of system we should strive toward. It's actually a complex issue that is hard to solve with a single legislative initiative. If you look at the top 30 healthcare systems in the world no two are exactly alike. This is because every country has their own unique challenges. Conservatives want us to emulate somewhere like The Netherlands which does not have any form of state-run healthcare. The government acts as a regulatory body and everyone buys insurance from companies that compete freely. This might be tough to achieve with the size of the country and the way states interact with each other.  Liberals want a system like Ireland or Norway which is a completely tax-funded single-payer system. The downside of this option is that it usually comes with a significant tax burden and can cause inefficiencies. In a country as large as the US this could get out of hand. The ACA is probably closest to Switzerland who also has an individual mandate. It's one of the better healthcare systems in the world and makes some sense for us. The point is that pretty much everybody outside of the far right wants universal healthcare. The problem is we just can't seem to agree on how we're going to pay for it.,
I've been an entrepreneur for 20 years and have been paying $500 a month for health insurance for me and my employees for those 20 years. That is pretty cheap for a family. I was on Obamacare when it first came out in New york and had  a great plan for $450 which was fantastic and much cheaper than any other option. And no deductible in plan. A lot depends on whether your state took the medicare example. But the real reason for the rise is the uncertainty caused by the republican sabotage. You want your premiums to go down ? Vote democratic. ,
The "process" has no integrity when the debate McCain voted to reopen consisted of backroom wheeling and dealing to secure votes for a bill that was written over lunch deliberately shutting one side out. My point? Praise for adhering to the letter of the rules is worthless when their spirit is completely disregarded. There's nothing "presidential" about playing the game when the opportunity to stop it was already there.McCain has my thanks for killing the bill but not for extending it a lifeline to begin with nor for voting for repeal and replace when it came up for a vote. Or for blocking Garland's nomination. Or for falsely claiming the ACA was pushed through with no debate or Republican input. I don't respect two-faced politicians. Our penchant for accepting shitty outcomes because said shitty outcomes were presented with politeness and a smile will be our undoing.,
What state pool are you in? They have a really bad plan and I am not seeing anything that compares in what I can find online. If you are provided your insurance through your employer as I suspect is the case your employer is the one furnishing the terrible plan with those kinds of increases and are likely using this as cover for buying a cheaper plan and pushing the costs on to you. Your increases are abnormal and are FAR outside of what most people have experienced. You realize insurance premium rates and deductibles rose more under Bush than they did under Obama right? So while the ACA is not perfect it stemmed the tide of the rate increases that were happening before with the added benefit of getting most people covered. ,
It does make sense. It is also not true. I'm sure you saw some people say they wanted McCain to die yesterday and I am sure you think you see those same people heralding McCain as a hero today. That is what is called confirmation bias. The truth is not that people are sheep and we should all be cynical. The truth is there were people who like McCain were frustrated with McCain were ambivalent towards McCain and who didn't like McCain on Reddit yesterday and there are people who like McCain were frustrated by McCain who were ambivalent about McCain and who hate McCain today. The volume may have changed but the numbers likely haven't. Also I getting tired of these lazy "Wait now everyone likes X now posts" that have been cropping up all over reddit. The main thesis of them being that people are somehow following a herd mentality when in fact that thesis is absurd. People have facets; issues have layers. Being able to hold two seemingly contrary opinions about someone is an example of intelligence not conformity. Especially when these issues are only contrary when you look at them in the most reductivist simplistic light. Anyway in my personal opinion wishing death on anyone no matter their political position is shitty behavior and I certainly don't condone it. Nor I'm sure does the vast majority of people including those of us on Reddit.  I would recommend that you give those who you were so scornful towards the benefit of the doubt. ,
Or you could stop lumping every Republican in together with each other and realize each senator and congressman represents their districts differently regardless of their political affiliation. There are really great Republican leaders out there especially in some of the traditional blue-states. In fact blue-state Republicans and red-state Democrats have been some of the best representatives this country has had and are great at providing some centrist force which you see people constantly complaining the American political landscape lacks.I know we are posting on r/politics and boo-hissing at the "supervillian" Republicans is all that goes on here but there is more to politics than just having your team win. Your attitude just sets us back more into the unproductive mire of criticizing people by the letter that comes after their name rather than their actions or what they achieve. ,
For your own information since you like to condescend to people even though you yourself cannot communicate what the changes are..[1] Change of Medicare subsidy from current scheme to per capita fixed block grant[2] $45B state grant for opiate-related addiction services (aka to fight the 'epidemic')[3] Allows insurers to offer more stripped down plans below current ACA standards so long as one or more plans in offering meet current ACA standards[4] Cap subsidy offered to those low income individuals purchasing insurance in marketplace to 350% of poverty level[5]  New subsidy structure would link to lower cost plans thus decreasing overall aid provided relative to the ACA[6] provide $70B to insurance companies to offset cost of high cost individuals[7] Elimination of individual mandate tax penalty[8] Scaling back of guaranteed coverage at the state level potentially allowing for reintroduction of annual lifetime limits[9] Medicaid would be better from covering abortions including Planned Parenthood (would lose funding for a period of 1 year)[10] Senate bill keeps investment income and payroll tax increases and expands a bailout to use HSA funding [11] Material tax breaks to medical device makers (although I am not clear on he mechanism driving this)Edit: Adding my source since several Reddit users appear to disagree and downvote a factual unbiased summary of changes..Also - I never said I was for or against the new bill I'm simply providing information so people can form their own opinion. Note I did not include CBO uninsured projection because they are just that - projections. It should be fairly obvious that reduced subsidies will lead to reduced coverage with some offset due to the potential for new low tiered (and affordable) plans.http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-obamacare-repeal/,
They want to pass tax reform later this year i.e. big old tax cuts.  They wanted to repeal the mandate to temporarily create a surplus of government money that they could then make those tax cuts against.  Without that surplus of money any tax cats they want to now pursue will cause a deficit.  There's a rule that basically says if a tax cut causes a deficit it has to pass with 60 votes instead of 50. So it's much harder to get their tax cuts without successfully repealing the ACA.There's also the overall idea of "Republican's don't cause deficits Democrats do" which ultimately is a lie but is an important lie to keep up for their base. ,
> Can they actually do that? Probably. Trump can probably direct the IRS to not enforce the penalties. Probably it will go to court. Probably the executive does have that power though. Probably. >Why were they attempting to remove the mandate through legislation if the executive (presumably) meaning Trump can just declare that they won't enforce it.Well clearly they wanted to do more than just that. But I think they can do that anyway and then just let them collapse. Notice Trump keeps saying they can do this? Trump has no idea what he can do or not do. The fact that he keeps saying this is evidence to me that someone is telling him this one of his lawyers for example. And from what I can tell they may well be right. ,
> Yep. If he voted no on the debate he probably would've retired due to health and potentially be replaced by a Republican that would've stuck to the party.> > > > There's also the fact that this is a budget reconciliation bill that was voted against. I belive you're confusing reconciliation with conference. Reconciliation is a special process specific to the Senate where certain types of budgetary bills aren't subject to filibuster. More detail on conference for others:Conference is where the House and the Senate meet to merge to different versions of similar bills. The House and Senate have to pass the exact same text of the legislation before it heads the presidents desk. This can lead to them voting on very similar legislation multiple times as was the case with the second Senate vote on the Russia sanctions bill. It was the basically the same bill but because the House made some slight changes it was necessary for them to hold a new vote on the specific text that was passed by the other chamber,
I would like to see a better healthcare system preferably something along the lines of single-payer or anything similar to that which achieves similar results. The problem is that the ACA just isn't that. I have been half-wishing for the Republicans to take care of the individual mandate for selfish reasons because if they don't I'll be getting a tax penalty at the end of the year. I only gained employment this year after many years of unemployment and I had no insurance during that time and I was willing to get insurance this year after I gained employment but by that point I already missed the enrollment window. I really didn't even want the insurance though because it feels like a massive ripoff. I understand that healthy people are needed to subsidize the sick people I understand how insurance works but you don't even get good insurance policies. It's garbage insurance policies and it costs a lot of money. I don't even earn much money the limits they set for where you qualify for assistance is awful. At the prices they charge for what I make I expect to get assistance especially if I'm going to get such a shitty insurance policy but I would be lucky to get any at all. In the end the tax penalty I might have to pay is most certainly less than what I would have had to pay for the insurance coverage. The worst part is that I basically don't even come close to ideologically aligning with Republicans/conservatives but I hate getting caught in a gap in the current legislation so it ends up better for me personally if the Republicans blow it up.,
I'm still struggling to think of what he could actually say or do that would be his "McCarthy moment".  There's got to be *something* right?  Or is too much of the American public too far gone for there to be any hope left that we will come to our senses?For reference:> At a session on June 9 1954 McCarthy charged that one of Welch's attorneys had ties to a Communist organization. As an amazed television audience looked on Welch responded with the immortal lines that ultimately ended McCarthy's career: "Until this moment Senator I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness." When McCarthy tried to continue his attack Welch angrily interrupted "Let us not assassinate this lad further senator. You have done enough. Have you no sense of decency?">> Overnight McCarthy's immense national popularity evaporated. Censured by his Senate colleagues ostracized by his party and ignored by the press McCarthy died three years later 48 years old and a broken man.[source](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Have_you_no_sense_of_decency.htm),
half of his supporters were already calling for McCain to die because he's stood up to Trump once or twice before now.Hell the Nevada GOP chairwoman retweeted that terrible thing about wanting McCain to drop dead.This will just reinforce it. I hope McCain refuses to retire for months just to tacitly retaliate at the GOP for their abuse of him that's going to be happening this week.(since that would reduce the repubs to 51 vs 48 it would mean if 2 GOP vote with the Dems the GOP can't pass anything rather than being a tie that Pence gets to break),
So I feel bad agreeing with even a portion of a parody of what Trump might say and I want the outcome where Americans get to keep healthcare but why can McCain still vote with a brain tumour? It strikes me that any legitimate physical ailment that is discovered partway through your term should preempt you from participating in government.I'm not sure what percentage of the people have ever dealt with people who have brain cancer but it's been my experience that you get a lot of super sketchy decisions and personality changes before you get to "non-functional confined to a hospital bed" level. I'm glad for the outcome but I don't think McCain should be voting on things right now.,
Well articles of impeachment originate in the House. If all Democrats voted in favor of impeachment 24 Republican representatives would need to defect in order for the resolution to proceed to the Senate.Once it reaches the Senate if again all Democrats voted in favor (along with their caucusing Independents) about 20 Republicans would need to join up.In short unless Trump does something drastic and I mean **drastic** even for Trump impeachment is very much a pipe dream. At least for the time being; we'll need to see how Mueller's investigation goes.Until the investigation concludes I personally think that citizens should be directing their energy toward repeating outcomes like that of tonight. That is pressure the legislature into preventing Trump's harebrained regressive and inevitably disastrous policies from being enacted.,
I think the problem was that there wasn't really a bill of substance to vote on. Instead they were using the motion to proceed to strong-arm other Republicans into putting their money where their mouths are and voting on something - anything - that resembles an Obamacare repeal. It came down to the last second and ultimately didn't pass because they were trying to write and pass a new bill in 20 hours. McCain bashed the process Republicans were using to force something through in a clearly partisan way that Americans didn't support then voted on continuing that process. Yes I'm glad he voted against the skinny repeal but I still thought it was hypocritical to vote on the motion to proceed then shit on that same process immediately ,
>  Of course it doesn't."With all the norms being busted up and defenestrated like useless garbage I think people were right to be alarmed at every step along this crazy process. I'm all for returning to normalcy in Congress and the White House. I want debate to be treasured - America shouldn't be in the business of trying to ram through bills with no discussion and marginal support. Real bipartisanship should be the norm not just a label slapped on something that is 99% partisan. Not sure it can happen right now but it's something we should be working towards. ,
Having brain cancer = sympathy toward McCain and hope that he beats the odds. Voting to move forward with a terrible bill =  no sympathy toward McCain because it was a bad thing to do. Voting against the final bill = good on McCain.These things don't contradict each other. If all you saw  was "McCain Good then McCain Bad then McCain good again" that's just a short attention span on your part not any contradiction from people who have condemned or praised his respective votes based on their substance and context. Honestly that's just a mind bogglingly stupid misunderstanding of the situation.,
I do know what the Senate is and why. I also don't like how undemocratic it is. The disparity in representation by population is nothing like what the framers could've foreseen. The idea that a chunk of land deserves representation more than a person is not something I can get behind.And while you say you're not trying to be an ass you're kind of coming off as one. Even if I had no idea why the Senate was undemocratic it's still terribly undemocratic and it's not unreasonable to dislike that and its effect on the workings of our government. I find it disingenuous that you wouldn't understand that.,
It's possible that McCain took one for the team as it were. Collins and Murkowski don't seem concerned about getting primaried so they can vote no without really worrying. All the other Republican senators that are on the fence about this for one reason or another are now massively exposed to primary challenges from the right because "they voted to keep obamacare." So McCain agrees to become the decisive no vote since he's not thinking about reelection anymore. The Republican senators that don't like repeal get both the real world outcome they want (constituents keep healthcare) as well as the ability to say they voted to kill obamacare with a recorded senate vote to prove it. This strengthens their overall hand in the 2018 midterms and reduces the already slim chance of them losing control of the senate. And maybe in the (slightly better) world McCain was talking about the other day the senate returns to normal order and tries to do other actually useful stuff like helping to pass a budget.,
A year ago I'd have agreed on the understanding that McConnell would never mess up like that - that he had a full and firm grip on the Republicans.Now though?  Crazy stuff is happening in DC. My sense is that the Republicans are more out of control internally than can be explained by the overt political stuff with Trump and the division between the institutional/moderates (by Republican standards) and the over-the-edge base of the party.  Probably the cleanest explanation is that like how the Steele Dossier was widely known around DC prior to it's publication there's a bunch of stuff on Trump that people "know" but haven't been verified by professional journalists or that the intel folks and/or Mueller have requested that politicians and journalists don't disclose.,
> Idk what Trump was thinking trying to bully & embaress her. Donald Trump does not frequently handle formidable people--at least not in a situation where he doesn't have overwhelming power going into the discussion.  Lisa Murkowski is *extremely* formidable.  As a result Trump tried to improve his position by threatening the people of Alaska here tried to leverage something...and it backfired massively.I've said it over and over again--Donald Trump is not a sophisticated negotiator.  He does effectively use bluster and a high reserve price--but previously he was never negotiating for anything particularly important nothing so important he couldn't just push back and walk away from the table.  Suddenly he's in an arena where neither of those tactics works very well at all (especially abandoning negotiations) and he's totally flummoxed because he's been drinking his own goddamn Flavor-Aid for so long he can't understand why he's not getting anything done.  Good.  Fuck him.  ,
We really need to emphasize and celebrate just how dangerously Fucking close we got to a full on Reconciliation repeal. With that third vote. Yes a full on repeal.McCain literally SAVED fucking healthcare with the deciding vote. Here's what would have happened with the "Skinny Repeal."It has just one or two provisions to remove mandates. Supportable.It passes final vote.It gets moved to house and senate conference committee led by Mitch Turtleface. Mitch handpicks the most loyal rank-and-file that will blindly vote yes.Mitch Turtleface **Alters everything on that bill to write whatever he sees fit including but not limited to something entirely different than what the Senate voted for. Then gets Paul Ryan to copy his bill.** (read: he pulls an H.R.3590 Military Housing Bill).He repeals anything and everything he wants conforming with Reconciliation stipulations.McConnell could have literally just made the third vote say "we'll cut $20 tax per person" just to get the nod which is why it dangerously had the highest chance of passing bar none.,
>maybe the brush with mortality gave him some moral clarityI seriously think the tumor was causing him some cognitive issues and had been for a while. We'd been watching him become increasingly incoherent and irrational for years and then on his first post-op appearance he seemed much more like the "old" McCain in terms of both content and delivery. We know it was 5cm on one dimension or another (not a small thing to be taking up space inside one's skull) and judging by the position of the bandage it could have been putting pressure on Broca's area and the prefrontal cortex the areas most strongly associated with higher-level thinking and processing speech.Just a thought.,
McCain has been at this for a long time. He voted for the motion to proceed so that it would get more attention and be even more of a disaster for the GOP. McCain knew they didn't have a decent bill and by letting it go to the floor while a bit of a risk he knew it would likely fail with his vote (he likely worked something out ahead of time with Murkowski and Collins) and be far more of a shit-show spectacle. People like McCain and McConnell have been in a the senate a long time. They play chess not checkers. ,
Same I took a wait and see approach earlier this week before piling in. He's still a a Republican and has many views I vehemently disagree with but i never doubt he loves the country and respects the people and doesn't want to see it all flushed down the toilet. Can't say the same for most Republicans these days. If Joe Biden considers him a dear friend he can't be all bad.I think McCain gets a lot of shit from the left because we've come to expect more from him than the mafia like sentiment that has taken over the party. So when he does vote party lines it tends to make people all the more outraged. I try to remember he's one of the few votes you can at least hope will stop some destructive shit from happening to the country. It's definitely a bad thing in my mind he might not be there to fill that role for long.,
That's a fucking dumb thing to say. And I hate how that has become some sort of fall back of an argument when it is a complete shithole of one. McCain for all his flaws has been very consistent in his position. He has been extremely forthcoming in what stance he would take on any vote on the bill. People can debate all they like on his policies but proclaiming his cancer as if that has somehow in any way altered his stance holds no basis in reality and is as toxic on the national stage if not more so as the petty politics that have pervated the absolute worst of national discourse over the past 2 years. Shame on you for even trying to be so sardonic. ,
It's not a small benefit at all.Every failure is a reminder for the people who held their noses and voted for Trump that they backed an incompetent narcissistic halfwit who is so engrossed in his own personal bullshit (and potentially treasonous activities) that he has no capacity or interest in actually trying to govern. Who still has such a fundamental misunderstanding of how the healthcare system functions that he said just a week(?) ago that he believes that a 21 year old's insurance costs $12 per year. Contrast that with Obama and how involved he was in the passing of the ACA.It's a reminder that we only have one serious political party in this country. That after 7 years of constant complaining and just-for-show repeal votes on Obamacare when the chips are down and the republicans have to put their plan on paper they have absolutely nothing. That when they own both houses of congress and the presidency they still can't get anything done due to their complete lack of vision and petty bickering and infighting born of years and years of bullshit purity tests that ultimately lead to a completely non-functional party. That the absolute best they could come up with was a plan that would have thrown 15 million Americans off health insurance and devastated an industry that represents 1/6 of the economy and that they knew it was so bad that they tried to sneak it through without showing it to anyone until hours before the vote. That a good portion of them are on tape just hours before the vote talking about how bad the bill was and then voted for it anyway. What the republicans just attempted to do and how they've attempted to do it is so flagrantly undemocratic that if it does not offend you there is something deeply wrong with you.,
I think people are trying to temper the praise though.  You know that tomorrow it's going to be him touted as THE hero but if it wasn't for people like Murkowski or Collins it would have never gotten that far.  Had one of those two ever flipped in the last few months we would have had a bill incredibly worse than even this one.  For that reason I don't think it's cynical to put what is coming off collectively as hyperbolic praise into context.  The guy has literally been saying one thing but voting another way for years and years.  It's been especially bad lately as he has one of the highest pro Trump agenda voting records (as tracked by 538).Was his vote today heroic and good for America?  Yes absolutely.  Was his behavior leading up to today reckless and dangerous though?  Probably.  One person flips and we're looking at a conference with the more conservative House having all the leverage.    ,
They're not giving McCain *more* credit.  They're happy he turned to the other side.  Fucking Christ is this so hard to understand?>does that person deserve more praiseYES.  Actually if someone did that I'd fucking kiss them and tell them thank you thank you thank you for having a change of heart.  Also this is a discussion board where we discuss interesting things that happened.  It's interesting that McCain changed his vote.  It's not interesting that two women who said they were going to vote a way voted that way.It's entirely natural for people to focus on the man who changed his reason why because of the questions it brings up.  ,
For me a Latvian the testimony highlights my biggest fear - that the KGB methods of torture (e.g. jail cells with constant lighting and a lack of beds) still exist in Russia and if push comes to shove and Russians decide to ''liberate minorities'' in my country there is a chance that I will be tortured and murdered just as my countrymen in 1940 and 1944-up until the end of Stalins reign when the punishments became more lax. It's a horrible chilling feeling. That testimony has almost guaranteed I am not ever stepping a single foot inside of Russia as much as I want to take the Transsiberian railroad visit St. Petersburg and all the small towns east of the Urals. ,
> "You have to decide if you want socialized medicine or European health care?"     That's an obvious choice isn't it? European healthcare.  As a Dutchman I can say we have quite good basic healthcare here at decent premiums (about $100/month) for everyone (people that have trouble to afford the premium get partial compensation).  And choice packages for expanded healthcare (eg physiotherapy  or other paramedical stuff even alternative medicine if that's your thing) for some additional costs ($10 here $10 there nothing extraordindary).    And here comes the strange part: Healthcare is 11% of the government budget here. In the US it's 16%. (2014 numbers but isn't much different now I guess).  So if you have European healthcare you'd have **full coverage** with **great healthcare** (life expectancy is 2½ years higher than US) at **lower premiums** and at **lower goverment costs**.  What's not to like? Well maybe the fact that it's *mandatory* for everyone?    And for what it's worth: People here still complain a lot that it's far too expensive by the way. ,
As far as I understand yes. On balance the filibuster is way better for them than the Dems though by virtue of the fact that it is so much harder to take something away from people than to prevent them from realizing how much better their lives would be if they had it. So even though removing it gives them the ability to passing sweeping legislation with a narrow majority it does the same thing for the Democrats meaning every single time Dems get a simple majority they can start "giving a bunch of goodies" to the destitute and impoverished meaning that their next majority lets them kill everything but only at the cost of EXTREME unpopularity like they're facing now. If they had ideas that actually helped people in actual reality and not the alternative reality they all think they live in that might not be the case but the only thing they are actually capable of doing is stopping progress and the best way to do that is to filibuster legislation so that it never happens in the first place. I guess if they get desperate enough they may come unhinged even further but it seems to me that if they actually wanted to kill the legislative filibuster they would have just done it off the bat and moved on.,
1st he did denounce the bill.  He was incredibly harsh about it in his speech.2nd if the MTP goes down the bill can still be brought back.  Again regular order used to mean that the MTP vote was nearly unanimous.  That changed under Reid when McConnel started using it.  the MTP vote doesn't kill a bill it just delays it to when they can get they votes to proceed.  The bill just sits there like a turd for a while until they bribe someone to vote for it.  McCain stood up said the bill was bad said the process was bad said he wasn't going to vote for it BUT would hear the debate of the "idea" of the bill and then finally voted and said "No this bill is bad in process and in it's idea." As liberals we have to respect someone who's willing to hear the debate.  I understand why the Dem's voted to try and kill it early but imo they were wrong.  They didn't want to risk a chance of it getting through but they didn't follow the spirit of the Senate by voting for refusing to hear the debate of the bill.,
Not practiced pro-cut rhetoric.  He was saying he would not vote on this bill but would vote to get it to the floor.  Essentially he did exactly what he said he would do—vote to open debate but not vote on the bill itself unless significant changes happened—whereas others who said the bill was a disaster still fell in line. It's significant because Reconciliation can only happen once per year but has to *actually* get to Reconciliation before that yearly limit happens.  If I'm reading into all this right if McCain voted no on a previous step of the process we'd be continuing this fight to prevent a 50-vote simple majority from pushing an ACA repeal tomorrow.  *Because* it got this far we now have a year in which it can only be repealed by a 60-vote filibuster-proof majority.  Republicans got exactly one chance to exclude Democrats from the repeal/replace process and McCain unexpectedly sunk it.,
I don't know why this sentiment got so popular on Reddit since it ignores the basic principle around politics; political capital.McCain isn't a one man army. He can't just oppose Trump AND vote against him for a lot of reasons. He'll lose credibility with his fellow GOP senators he'll lose trust amongst the conservative constituents that voted for him and he'll lose re-election. His greatest influence in speaking out against Trump is as a senior level senator and to maintain that position he has to vote with the party the vast vast majority of the time. The reality is aside from probably Lindsey Graham McCain is the highest level guy from the GOP actually doing anything to oppose Trump and instead of redditors giving him credit for that they hate on him for not giving up his political capital to make a grand gesture that will lose him his Senate seat.You can't take down the President alone and by McCain speaking out he's building momentum in a resistance within the GOP. We should be encouraging people on the right to do what McCain has been doing so that they can finally build a solid enough base of support within the party to be able to vote against Trump consistently without losing their position in the Senate. The unintelligent and ignorant way Reddit reacts to McCain and people like him is a reflection of how little people take the time to learn how to function in the political world. ,
It will take a few weeks but they will think of something. It's much harder for Ryan because he has to deal with the Freedom Caucus. It's entirely possible that they could end up getting too conservative and risk losing the one or two moderates in the Senate but I think McConnell is savvy enough to get them in line next time around. Now that they have shown they arent afraid to buck their own party this gives them a ton of leverage and every one has a price so they will get what they want and McConnell will get what he wants one way or another.The only thing Ryan cares about is getting to his big tax cuts for the rich and he cant do that until they find additional savings from gutting Medicare/Medicaid via Obamacare. There may not be another vote for awhile but these people will never ever stop bitching about Obamacare. They will keep writing one garbage bill after another until *something* *anything* is signed by Trump,
>There were hundreds of amendments added to the ACA that were written by Republicans because the Democrats wanted it to be a bipartisan piece of legislation. Cut the bullshit you're lying through your teeth.Politifact rates your claim as: [Half True.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/16/luis-gutierrez/rep-gutierrez-says-hundreds-republican-amendments-/)>When the ACA was making its way through Congress former President Barack Obama made a similar statement in September 2009. During a joint address to Congress he said that his plan incorporated the ideas of both Republicans and Democrats. We rated that claim Mostly False because many of the amendments Republicans introduced were technical in nature.>Republicans had several opportunities to introduce amendments to the Affordable Care Act in both the Senate and House bills. Ultimately for procedural reasons tied to the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy D-Mass. the Senate version was the only one that moved forward.>For example 788 amendments were submitted during the ACA’s markup in the Senate Committee for Health Education Labor and Pensions committee (HELP). [...] Of those 161 were adopted in whole or revised form.>Only two of those Republican amendments were passed via roll-call vote.>The Senate Finance Committee took up another version of the bill. Senators initially offered 564 amendments. During that markup about six Republican amendments were adopted via roll call vote and others were adopted by unanimous consentI'll leave the rest of the reading up to you; but you cannot argue that they got what they wanted.,
>Why would they vote for a bill that would dismantle their landmark legislation and kill Americans?Precisely. If their argument had merit then it would take a very proactive discussion to dissuade them otherwise. If the merits are weak then you shy away from discussion. There was no need to avoid discussion here; but when the time came there was a lot of name calling as if the discussion should not even be had.The removal of the preexisting condition clauses for example is a great step forward. But to mandate that even the healthiest of people must pay for coverage they don't need or want is an issue. Drawing party lines prevents any discussion about actual issues with the ACA.,
You obviously know about Universal health care.Tell me do you get fined huge sums of money if you choose not to get health insurance?Are you incredibly restricted in your choice of hospital where if you happen to suffer life threatening injuries outside of a hospital not in your insurers network they will instead transfer you to your partnered hospital even if its 20km away unless you want a mortgage-sized bill?Do you have 1 single insurer to choose from where you are forced to pay $1000 a month for coverage because there's no other option?Obamacare is all of these. There is nothing about it that resembles what a proper universal health care system should look like. Its some incredibly broken extortion racket that the democrats have somehow brainwashed people into thinking its progressive. Saying that its 'as close as America will ever get' to a passable health care system is not too different to saying "Kim Jong-Un is as close to a democratic leader that the people of NK will ever get so they should be grateful for him.",
The inherent flaws are visible in the results I've made a nice table to show you.http://i.imgur.com/zMgygQD.pngAs for the bailouts that stuff has been widely reported (including by the likes of the washington post/huffington post) as DOJ recovered funds propping up Obamacare insurers.I never said democrats travel less than republicans. Republicans are brainwashed into thinking universal health care is bad because taxation is theft. Democrats are brainwashed into thinking Obamacare isn't the worst health care system on Earth. Obamacare needs to die and the only way it will go down quickly is by democrats thus it is important that they travel to witness just how bad it is.,
Not all that.Employer based healthcare insurance is also subsidised by the employer so that 200 monthly cost you have? Likely it is a 600 dollar per month plan. Dental and vision are usually separate plans.Another big issue is that if you change employers you change insurance. Some people work for municipalities for lower pay versus private sector because of the superior health and other benefits.Another issue is that one of the largest insurance companies is not allowed by law to negotiate prices (Medicare). What ends up happening is that drug prices go up tenfold and then some insurances get an awesome discount off that high price (competing in pharmaceutical industry is difficult).,
Yes you can force hospitals to charge less - each year arbitrary billing means the CEO down to the nepotism driven administrative assistant is taking home bonuses totaling millions of dollars. The board of trustees or whatever runs the hospital gets their share of the pie in the millions of dollars. The money going into the hospitals from Medicare & insurance is in the 100s of millions of dollars. If you still think health insurance practices have nothing to do with these problems & these two industries aren't colluding bigly you have no idea what you are talking about. People have the right to obtain health care when they want it right now the health insurance & hospital system basically makes it impossible for reasonably priced access to health care including seeing specialists getting labs & meds. I don't care if there is a country that US wants to emulate or which system or create regulatory measures to free the health insurance enslaved doctors but it needs to be done now. ,
Pulled out of the paris climate accord which saved us billions in the future. Dealt some huge blows to ISIS. Jobs market is growing stock market is at an all time high. Strengthening our reputation as having balls on the world stage again. SJW policies are dwindling down to manageable levels. Illegal immigration drastically decreased. Exposing the fake news due to his social media usage. And this is just 6 months in with a very obstructionist dem party trying to crucify him but go ahead and cry about how he's just "the worst" hope you're ready for 7 more years hahahaha so naive. ,
So your response to unscrupulous politicians undermining the spirit of the political framework is to encourage more politicians to do the same? Surefire way to spiral the system into depravity and Trump pal.In response to an abuse of the framework your response should be to enthusiastically campaign for politicians to restore the proper order not engage in a race to the bottom. That's just throwing the baby out with the bath water pal.McCain is one of the few key politicians actively and openly pushing bi partisanship and for people to respect the nature of the senate. Rather than applauding this you deride him because he disagrees with your politic views. ,
And if yours hadn't told a bold-faced lie to the entire country and his own party we wouldn't be in this mess to begin with.  ACA is entirely on the shoulders of Barry and the Democrat party not a single Republican voted for the thing because they saw it for what it was - a vehicle to break the then current method of healthcare in order to pave the way for single payer.So congratulations you've won.  You've broken the camel's back.  Hope that single payer feels worth it when you or a loved one is waiting 48 weeks for neurosurgery or 18 weeks for a hysterectomy or is told that no you can't go have that experimental surgery that has a slim chance of extending  their life for a few more months even though you have the cash to spend on it because someone in the government decided that they should "die with dignity" rather than take a chance on a hope and a prayer procedure.,
Without the individual mandate nothing else matters. The GOP knows that is true. Single payer is the only way. Will save money and improve care since we don't have to pay the bloated insurance companies. We had a more affordable system in the past but with drug companies charging Americans more and making less generics medicine in super expensive. Surgery has gotten better early intervention is saving more people but the costs are huge. People are sick now because they can't afford the medicine so they go back to the hospital. Endless cycle.We offer Medicare for all get everybody paying a little bit and getting 100% coverage in return. We have to accept the fact that a small portion of our population can't or won't work. And that some are unfairly profiting of the sickness of our country men our. Our elderly and children. Our fellow American's.   ,
People like to have their local representatives. They like have someone from their district. So here's what I like. Double the size of the house (at least). These new representatives will be selected by the state parties but they must be selected to bring the party representation closer to the actual popular representation vote per the whole state. So let's look at a state that has 10 representatives. Assume the popular representative vote is 50 percent republican 40 percent democrat and 10 percent libertarian. But because of the wonders of packing and cracking the districts went 7 to Republican 3 to democrat. This is not that crazy of a result. New system: still 7 republican districts and 3 democratic districts but we get to start adding statewide reps to make it more closely align with the popular vote.Final tally: 10 republicans 8 democrats and 2 libertarians. You can see the fucking benefits right away. A.) the representation is in line with what the popular vote was. B.) THIRD PARTIES FINALLY START GETTING A FOOTHOLD!! If you add some kind of instant run-off or approval voting and third parties would get even stronger. This I think would be ideal. And if this were implemented gerrymandering would just die by itself because what's the point? And Dems in wildly red districts and vice versa actually have representation and a reason to go vote. No one can say their vote doesn't matter. Wouldn't this be beautiful?,
As I said it isn't really gerrymandering but the way demographics have happened and state lines were drawn worked out to something basically similar.No it isn't what the point of drawing state lines was but intent doesn't matter as much as results from my POV and the result was a situation even more horribly anti-democratic and generally awful than the Senate was back in 1790. It started out as a horrible idea and as time advanced it turned into a steadily more and more horrible idea.I honestly believe that the structure of the US Senate will be what ultimately destroys America when the urban majority finally decides they will no longer tolerate being dictated to by a tiny handful of rural arch-conservatives.,
I mean McConnell could very well lose his seat as majority leader after this failed vote. McConnell employed a scorched earth approach towards winning the senate and many GOP senators begrudgingly followed him only because he was actually getting wins. They sold their souls to the devil to get the Senate victory but it was all under the condition that McConnell had to keep pushing out victories to keep his seat because the moment he couldn't there would be GOP Senators looking for his head. McConnell really didn't want to lose this battle. As for moving back to the simple majority rule by repeal I think the 60 majority rule should be mandatory because it forces bipartisanship. The simple 51 majority allows for the majority party rule with an iron fist never having to pay attention to the minority party. 60 vote encourages compromise and I think in a country as massive as ours compromise is necessary.  ,
> Probably. Trump can probably direct the IRS to not enforce the penalties. Probably it will go to court. Probably the executive does have that power though. Probably.It is the constitutional responsibility of the executive to duly enforce the laws created by the legislature otherwise known as the take care or faithful execution clause. I am like 90% sure the the ACA does not give the executive any wiggle room in deciding whether or not to enforce the individual mandate thus if they did do this they'd probably lose a court case pretty quickly. And considering the mandate only matters once a year at the cutoff for marketplace sign-up I don't think it would effect things too much.The CSR payments to insurance companies are much more important right now as Trump *is* thinking of ending those and the question of whether he can and if it will blow up the markets is kind of up in the air.,
On the real though your implication that the majority of American soldiers killed and raped innocent "yellow" people is inaccurate at best and pretty offensive/insulting at worst. While I absolutely agree we should have not been in Vietnam and it was even more awful people were FORCED to fight an unjust and immoral war there were plenty more people who did not want to fight who did not have that luxury of getting out of it that this man did because of his wealthy father. It's even more galling because this man who did not join the military voluntarily or otherwise has insulted our veterans and current military members is hawkish is the commander in chief of our armed forces and worst of all is trying to dictate who can or cannot serve when he himself did not.So yeah unequivocally fuck this guy ,
I too have terminal brain cancer but have lost none of my cognitive functions.  I was diagnosed 12 months ago and given 3-6 months as it was at Stage IV there were multiple tumors including a massive one pressing on my brain stem giving me headaches making me tired and giving me poor balance. There were no other symptoms and I attributed the symptoms to my new and challenging job. Two major surgeries (within one week) six months of chemo and radiation have  not affected logic reasoningshort- or long-term memory decision making etc.  I have a comprehensive cognitive test with the neurologist every 3 months.  The first was a few weeks after surgery and set the baseline the subsequent tests check if there has been any decline - so far none.  I am lucky being young female (it's typically a diease affecting middle aged men and sadly children)  otherwise healthy and physically resilient.  I was also lucky to get on an immunotherapy drug trial that my oncologist hopes will extend my life for 12-18 months.  The side effects of immunotherapy have been horrific but if it stops (or slows) the inevitable decline it will be worth it.So McCain may not have lost *any* of his cognitive or mental capacity yet.  Admittedly his age and medical history suggest his decline will be rapid but he may have around 12 months of unimpaired cognitive function.

Because it wasn't a simple vote to debate on a bill. Voting yes on the motion to debate was validating the back door partisan tactics the Republicans were implementing in a desperate attempt to shove bad legislation through a process.It also wasn't as innocent as a simple debate or conversation.  They voted yes to open up the amendment period which means changes could be made at will to the legislation.  This normally isn't a problem but literally zero representatives knew what was actually in the bill they were amending and voting on because it hadn't been shared. There were even *Republicans* who were excluded from the writing and formation of the bill.If it helps you understand why people are upset with McCain it's because a vote for yes on the motion to debate is a vote for allowing Republicans to try and get a heist over on the entire process.  What happened this week *is not normal* and voting yes on the motion to debate normalized every single step of it....  Basically it weakens our democratic process over all.,
You may be right but "Battling brain cancer" "legendary political career" and "stalwart loyal opposition to the Donald Trump and the corruption by radical and reactionary elements of the party he built and defended" make for such stirring docudrama material...(I admit that last one is a bit wordy) A bit of /s on the sound bites.Edit: just read an article about Murkowski and Collins. They definitely deserve credit for their stand on principal. I was also fairly surprised to learn how few women there are in the senate. People talk about women being underrepresented in STEM fields but I believe 21% (21/100 in the senate) is a lower percentage than women in STEM. ,
I may come across as an ass and I apologize but it's hard for me not to feel a bit defensive about a system I personally feel has been incredibly successful and has been both adaptive and open to critique. Your disagreement over a "chunk of land" deserving representation goes back to the founding of the country so I honestly don't mean to dismiss that. But it is the compromise they came up with and I can't help but see how it benefits both sides. Small states with small populations are able to be represented in ways where they would otherwise be entirely ignored. And if that were the case why would they bother being part of the Union in the first place?,
That's a very generous assessment. I doubt all of that 2018 forethought was in their minds though due to the haphazard nature of these recent votes.I can't see how the Republicans will suddenly work together across the aisle on much of anything since that would be seen as contradictory in that they literally "worked together with the liberals" -- even if any such legislation would benefit Americans overall.Ultimately what it seems is that Republicans are masters of spin can't take responsibility for much of anything and can apparently do no wrong. Plus they know how short the average American's attention span is.,
No way Mitch McConnell isn't that good an actor.  I saw his face on the floor of the Senate when McCain said no and afterwards he was devastated.This was his plan (at least his backup plan) all along.  Get it to conference.  Sit on it with House Republicans while he quietly cuts deals with the 50 members he needs to cut deals with really only 7ish make a deal with the House and get it passed.I think he was pretty stunned because even though it was a scummy process with secretive backroom deals no public debate and a slipshod approach to public policy it might have really been passed in the end which was his only goal and I think he managed to communicate that to most of his Caucus but apparently some people have principles (at least now that they have brain cancer).,
During every election cycle a successful candidate must win two elections: the primary and the general election.The primary is an election held among voters of your own party.  It is contested by people hoping to represent that party in the general election.  Most voters in a primary are looking for the candidate most likely to win in the general because they're most concerned with seeing their party win.  When there's an incumbent (someone who currently represents the district/state) they usually win the primary in a breeze because it has already been established that they are capable of winning a general election.However a few people do not go into primaries with winning the general election in mind but rather with the hopes of getting someone who represents their viewpoints more specifically.  These people do not identify with a party as a whole but rather with a more specific sub-set of the party.  Often these people will vote against an incumbent candidate in hopes of getting someone more conservative on the ballot.That this is even possible is usually due to gerrymandering.  Gerrymandering is when politicians draw up districts with the specific purpose of making electoral victory easier.  So instead of most districts being 50% republican 50% democrat they might make 4 districts 60% republican 40% democrat and 1 district 90% democrat 10% republican.  This makes it easier for parties to win election but it also has the side effect of making the primary the real election; it means that voters can toss out a moderate incumbent in favour of a left or right wing extremist and still win because they engineered their district boundaries to be impossible to lose.In some cases such as with Mrs. Murkowski party bosses will be unhappy with a representative or senator who does not vote with their party's wishes 100%.  This will cause influential party leadership in Washington to threaten a representative or senator with "getting primaried."  In this case that would mean that they would hunt for a strong candidate who is more loyal to the party and run that strong candidate against them in the primary with the hopes of defeating the incumbent.  This again goes against convention because incumbents rarely face strong challenges in the primary since it has been established that they're capable of winning the general.  It implies the party bosses are out to get that candidate and are not concerned about that candidate's well-being.If a candidate loses a primary election they no longer get to represent their party in the general election.  When an incumbent loses a primary it usually means they're out of a job but they sometimes have the option of running as an independent who is not affiliated with a party.  (Famously Joe Lieberman did this.)  The usual result of this is a vote split among the two candidates who represent or used to represent the one party causing the other party to win the election.  However in rare cases the incumbent will win re-election over the person they lost the primary to.  This is what happened with Mrs. Murkowski.  The usual result is a sitting senator/representative who is pissed at his/her own party and as a result votes much more independently than they otherwise would have.,
Yes but that's why I pointed out she's pretty influential herself. For example she literally chairs the Senate Energy Committee. lol Which is probably one of the biggest things that Alaska is depedent on. So hypothetically speaking to give the most radical scenarios she could literally push to bundle shit that Alaska wants with shit that Trump needs on energy policy to prevent a veto or even poison pill shit Trump wants on energy policy to force a veto or kill a bill on the floor and since Trump doesn't have a line-item veto he can't really do much about it.....outside of pressuring McConnel to fire her but that right there is probably another media clusterfuck that many wanna avoid and one that would likely just cement her resolve on razor-thin votes like this.   **EDIT:** Also as the person below me linked she can also stall Trump's Department of the Interior & Department of Energy nominees as she has already done to a degree after Trump's first attempt to publically humiliate her.,
I think you're missing what he's saying. He's not saying that the committee is gonna fix the problems with the bill. There's differences between the Senate version of the healthcare bill and the house version. That means that if the senate had passed it those differences would still need to be resolved before it went to trump. The two ways to do that would be for either the house to just accept the senate version of the bill or a committee to be formed to take the two versions and fix the fact that there's differences. His point is that even if this had passed it's a crapshoot as to what changes the committee would make and it would be surprising if we ended up with a bill that was somehow worse than either of the ones passed ,
>The protesters staged a “die-in” in front of the office with many of the protesters in wheelchairs removing themselves from the chairs then lying on the floor.>Laura Halvorson 33 also a protester said many of those who participated in the die-in resisted arrest and were then removed by Capitol Police without their wheelchairs — images that attracted significant attention on social media. She said they were later reunited with their wheelchairs.So they removed themselves from their wheelchairs in protest and we're reunited after they were picked up and arrested. Not "ripped out of their wheelchairs". Way to really indulge in the pathos.,
There are quite a few yoohoos in the House (in part because there are so many of them compared to the Senate) but as a general rule senators are not stupid people. Moreover with the term length being six years they have more time to learn how everything (and everyone) works in the legislature and that's by design. The Senate was always intended to have a kind of collegiality that the House lacks which is one of the reasons that the extreme partisanship of recent years is scary.And yeah I do think that McCain voted yes on the motion to proceed earlier with every intention of voting no when things came to a head.,
> I couldn't care less about Obamacare repeal or whatever.See this is why this is a problem. You don't care because it doesn't affect you. None of you care unless it directly affects your personal lives.> At least I'm wise enough to acknowledge that I am not smart enough to know which is best tbqh.Or too lazy to have a reasoned opinion about an issue that doesn't affect you?> Trump could spend the next 8 (yes... eight... bank on it) years with no major legislative victories at allLet me tell you what's going to happen. Trump's not going to spend the next 8 years in the oval office. In fact he's not going to spend the next 4 years. I'd be amazed if he makes it to year 2. He's going to be impeached. I know this for certain as much as you're certain that he's going to do 8. So lets agree to disagree.> He is still one of the most important Presidents to ever live.My prediction? History books will label him as the worst president to ever be elected.> Hillary is a footnote and will probably be on trial very soon.Uh huh. Keep talking about Hillary. I think it's starting to work.,
>  Still this version wouldn't have been as unpopular (the individual mandate while structurally imporant has always been the only part of the ACA that has polled badly).Republican propaganda is that the ACA is failing and is not fixable. If this bill had passed it would have likely broken the ACA to the extent that it would have genuinely fallen apart. The mandate is the part that pays for the rest and keeps premiums from being totally impossibly high.  That said I'm not a fan. This was a handout to the insurance companies from the beginning; we need single payer.,
>It effectively makes all Putins gains null and void outside of Russia. And Russia ain't got shit worth buying. Not much point in being a billionaire when you can't buy squat. The other issue is security. All these oligarchs that became super rich through corruption and theft can't keep their wealth tied to Russian assets because if they make an enemy with another powerful person they could lose everything the same way they gained it. Putin used to be able to assure his lackeys that they would be safe since they could just more everything to the west where rule of law exists. That's not possible anymore and as long as the act is in place those people face asset seizure from western officials.Putin is only safe in power if he can keep his oligarch lap dogs happy. If he can't they might turn on him if they can organize. ,
It's an absolutely barbaric move by Putin. American adoptions of Russians are not getting healthy happy children. The only kids that get sent to the US have illness or serious complications. The people adopting these kids are taking the weakest and most hopeless of children to give them a chance to live. Add to this the fact that many of the adoption cases in progress were for a sibling or family member of a child already here and you see he's breaking up families and holding hostages. By ending the program he's sentencing these children to a slow painful death. He's killing the hostages. Watch the testimony they're talk about it there. https://www.c-span.org/video/?431852-1/william-browder-overturning-magnitsky-act-putins-top-priority,
It's to apply pressure to people concerned about the wellbeing of seriously ill children (the only ones Russia was adopting out). As long as the Magnitsky Act remains law Russian children will suffer and it will be America's fault for not repealing the Magnitsky Act. Just look at how Trump Jr. tried to use the optics of the meeting supposedly being about Russian adoption. When it's Russian billionaire money at stake nobody gives a shit and there's nothing to hide behind. When the meeting supposedly ends up "actually about adoptions in Russia" everyone can say that the only offer made in exchange for dirt on Hillary was to help innocent children. That looks a LOT better than offering Russian support in the election in exchange for releasing billions in stolen money back to Russia's elites.,
So there's no such thing as "allowed protest votes". That's a myth. Collins and Murkowski weren't voting no every time because they were "allowed protest votes" as proven by how they were sometimes voting no with many other Republicans.If McConnell thought he could get them he absolutely would. Republican unity looks good. But he has basically written them both off because they voted down the MTP. Nobody's "allowed" them to vote against their party they're voting against their party because they believe that the bill is bad and that there won't be serious electoral consequences for them districts for tanking it.,
Well it's the same exact people as before but since then they have undergone an additional 6 months or so of radicalization in one of the most toxic environments available on the internet outside of the dark web. As you can imagine the results are not good.I always urge everyone I talk to about this to go and watch these people in their environment and to get an understanding for who they are. I believe a lot of people have an (understandable) aversion to looking at that kind of stuff but that aversion can deceptively lead them to believe that the opposing side is "not really that bad" and "just has different opinions". Nope. It's bad. Really bad. We would all benefit from shining the light on the roaches nests.,
>Tell me do you get fined huge sums of money if you choose not to get health insurance?  The other option was a tax hike like they do in every other country. Conservatives don't like taxes  >Are you incredibly restricted in your choice of hospital where if you happen to suffer life threatening injuries outside of a hospital not in your insurers network they will instead transfer you to your partnered hospital even if its 20km away unless you want a mortgage-sized bill?  No I'm not. Every hospital within 100 miles of me takes my insurance.  >Do you have 1 single insurer to choose from where you are forced to pay $1000 a month for coverage because there's no other option?  No. I pay $300/month to cover my whole family with $0 copay and no deductible. It doesn't cover inpatient services but I can get supplemental insurance for that. I'm also not above taking on medical debts and negotiating them down which is an option I'm surprised more people don't exercise,
I don't think you realize that all of your gripes about Obamacare (besides the individual mandate) we're around even before the ACA was implemented. High premiums few options for providers in-network coverage these were all things that were around before Obamacare. What the Obamacare did though was improve the baselines for what health plans covered (at a higher cost of course) and cement patient protections like not allowing patients to be kicked off of their plans for pre-existing conditions or have limits on their coverage. Healthcare in America was much worse before the ACA you should learn your history before you go and criticize what we have today. Yes we know its far from the best we could have but it is a vast improvement from what we had even if it does costs more.  ,
I would say we do have to pay for a bit of our prescribed medication which I think you might call a 'co-pay'? Not sure whether we call it that or something else here.  I've never seen prescribed medication cost very much though (comparative to our wages - I think the most expensive regular prescription medication I take is less than $20 for a pack that lasts me 2+ months?).  Our public health system isn't perfect and our conservative party is attempting to defund parts of it (what is with conservative political parties and dismantling public health?) but it's a good and efficient system.  We do get penalised (an extra 1% or something to the 2% we pay for the public health care safety net through our taxes) if we don't get some form of private health insurance after the age of 30 - but that being said you can get cheap coverage for like $20 - $30 a month (it covers almost nothing when it comes to extras but it fulfils the requirement to NOT get penalised).The first time I heard about what you (US) Americans go through I honestly thought my friend (who was from the US) was trying to prank me.  It's been a few years but I still remember the shock when I found out that people in the US could die from treatable early detected cancer if they didn't have enough money to pay for treatments.That stuff doesn't happen in most of the western world.  It just - doesn't.  And the thought that it does ... is frighteningly barbaric.Edit: okay I'm not sure what I said that people feel the need to downvote for.  I don't care about the downvotes but I'm really curious as to what I've said that made you mad.,
That's a well-sourced argument. I totally believe all of your claims. Except for the not true ones  1. You obviously haven't done much research into the history of price controls or how they work in practice. Here's a paper that mentions some of the potential drawbacks: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193364/  2. [The majority of hospitals in the US lose money on patient care](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/05/03/half-of-us-hospitals-lose-money-on-patient-care/). There are exceptions of course but the profitable hospitals aren't profitable because of the reasons you're touting.  3. Insurance companies don't like the current state of affairs any more than the public does. Obamacare has caused [losses almost across the board](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/15/news/economy/health-insurers-profits-obamacare/index.html). The reason they are pulling out of the marketplaces is because they are losing money there and the government hasn't done anything to help that.  4. Hospitals charge as much as they can within regulations to offset the cost of treatment. As I demonstrated above most of them are non-profits and the hospitals that make money are the exception not the rule. They'll make money regardless of who is paying for treatment.  5. Insurance companies work just like any other company. In an open marketplace with competition they will work to make their services as attractive and affordable as possible. Unfortunately the system we have created makes it difficult for them to achieve these ends.  The system we have in place is definitely broken but you can't just brute force a new one into place. That's how we got where we are now.,
>Pulled out of the paris climate accord which saved us billions in the future.Doing this was considered an incredible abandonment of leadership in the world. The Paris Accords were toothless but it was a diplomatic effort all-in-all. Trump's decision to pull from them was an abdication of responsibility to the rest of the world.As far as "saving us billions" he could have simply just not contributed the amount of money that we were implored to do and still could have stayed in the agreement bloc. It was an incredibly stupid decision and wouldn't have saved us any money compared to staying in it and just not paying.>Dealt some huge blows to ISIS.The blows he dealt to ISIS were already in motion with Obama.

His campaign is facing three separate investigations all of them headed up by Republicans. *He* is personally being investigated by a special prosecutor who is a Republican. One of his key campaign promises -- something he'd promise he'd do in his first 100 days -- just went down as one of the most disastrous and embarrassing policy wranglings in modern American political history. His other main policy initiative is tied up in the courts. His next legislative priority is already DOA because he spent what little political capital he had in trying to go in on healthcare and losing miserably. His new spokesman just had an incredibly childish meltdown. By his own standard he is on track to having a broken administration being on his second chief of staff *in six months*.What other president can you think of that has such an awful track record in such a short period of time? Be honest. ,
>So your response to unscrupulous politicians undermining the spirit of the political framework is to encourage more politicians to do the same? Surefire way to spiral the system into depravity and Trump pal.Have a Coke and a smile and calm the fuck down. I said McCain had the chance to end the charade on Tuesday and chose not to. I refuse to give him undue praise because of that.>In response to an abuse of the framework your response should be to enthusiastically campaign for politicians to restore the proper order not engage in a race to the bottom. That's just throwing the baby out with the bath water pal.I campaign for politicians who don't betray their constituents and lie about it. >McCain is one of the few key politicians actively and openly pushing bi partisanship and for people to respect the nature of the senate. Rather than applauding this you deride him because he disagrees with your politic views.I deride him because he's routinely spoken out against pieces of legislation he then votes for. I deride him for being complicit in blocking Merrick Garland's appointment. And I deride him for lying about the ACA up to and including yesterday.If you want to accept "proper order" as "no consequences for your past record so long as you throw us a bone now and then" there a few dozen banana republics that will be happy to have you.,
> because someone in the government decided that they should "die with dignity"That's exactly how it was before the ACA too though. Before the ACA I was refused insurance time and time again because of my arthritis. I work a full time job and make decent money but the ones that were willing to accept me wanted me to pay almost as much as 3 or 4 times more than everyone else. I take four different medications to manage my arthritis and there were months I had to pick and choose which medicines I needed due to not having insurance. Now with the ACA however I don't have to pick and choose though. I was able to get accepted and get on an affordable plan and I can afford all my medications now each month. The ACA has helped me tremendously and I've been called scum because of it. I've been called a leecher and that if I have to live in pain so others don't have to pay high premiums than so be it. Being targeted with comments like that has made me pretty darn unsympathetic to those that are hurt by the ACA. ,
You don't gerrymander a senate "district". Gerrymandering does not "affect" the voting rolls of the senate since the entire state votes for them at large. It does affect the republicans in the senate however by pushing the party to the right. The affects of gerrymandering on party politics is more likely to backfire on republicans in the senate since they can't gerrymander their way to a more comfortable district. Once the voters get turned off by the consistent push toward the right they'll be left out to dry. This is why you still have some republicans in swing states defying the republican orthodoxy. They have to protect their left flank while the house members really only have to protect their right. ,
I'm not sure about the IRS. Trump has shown himself willing to ignore the law. Who is going to enforce this if he tells the IRS head to stop enforcing the penalties? I mean sure it would be illegal. So what's the next step? Who has standing to bring the court case?>And considering the mandate only matters once a year at the cutoff for marketplace sign-up I don't think it would effect things too much.If they don't enforce the mandate young people who feel over-insured will be unworried about dropping insurance from that point on. Could have a pretty serious ripple effect. That could affect the markets quite a lot. I agree that CSR payments are what everyone's looking at now yes. But enforcement isn't settled yet in my estimation. ,
> On the real though your implication that the majority of American soldiers killed and raped innocent "yellow" people is inaccurate at bestWell one thing is for sure a whole fuckload of innocent yellow people *were* killed. I assume the blame is not evenly spread the bombing campaigns were most likely the worst part so that comes down on a relatively small number of heads.> there were plenty more people who did not want to fight who did not have that luxury of getting out of it that this man did because of his wealthy father.Yeah but honestly it's the one thing I can absolutely not fault him for. I would have done the exact same thing 100%. As a matter of fact I've done civilian rather than military service in my country as we luckily get a choice (... and we're not at war in some country on the other side of the globe).I mean yeah it's unfair but I don't quite see how him not 'draft-dodging' would have helped anything. The one thing that can be criticised but this is based on speculation is that most likely his issue didn't have anything to do with the ethics of war or having to kill people but more with the fact he wouldn't be able to eat gold leaf covered Trump steak for a while.,
    I don't know. My point isn't to defend Trump since he's the only person on the planet that I truly hate. It's that there is a danger in assuming things and then treating these assumptions as fact. In order to combat Trump we need air tight arguements. If we say "Trump hates Obamacare since it was made by a black guy" his supporters could defend him by saying that Obama being black is not relevant(and they could be right. It's plausible to think both that Trump is a rasist and that Trump has personal beef with Obama. I think both are true). If we say that he wants Obamacare replaced because he has a personal vendetta against Obama we have an argument that is completly provable,
You're right it really doesn't make a lot of sense. Seems to me like McCain was stuck between and rock and another rock given the choice of proceeding with the cat shit or stalling further. Either way his party looks incompetent. It was a risk he took to put the debate through and I don't know for sure but my thoughts are that he was active in making sure that the cat shit didn't get the votes it needed to pass to the house. (Maybe I'm just hoping he's actually a good guy at heart but that's my take on it),
This is right-wing politics in a nutshell. They will say they want to do X for reason Y that may or may not on a certain level makes sense. Brief analysis of the idea finds that not only is Y a clear cover and smokescreen X will lead to Z: something that is objectively and easily foreseeable as undesirable (which includes not even getting the benefit of the supposed Y). Z will never be discussed and Y will get stuck in and accepted in the minds of those that would be damaged by Z. X will happen. Z will happen. Y may or may not actually happen. The world is net worse unless you are in a very very small minority that benefits from X and/or Z and/or Y.Working/middle class voters that are like "hurr I have more money in my wallet" after a tax decrease drive me the fuck up the walls.,
If the framers were so damn good at making a government we wouldn't have had a civil war. Just because that's the way they made it doesn't mean it's the best way to make it. The Senate is terribly unfair to people who live in populous states which is to say most people. The House is too because they haven't increased its size for a hundred years. Look at how government has been working lately and tell me again how great it is. In an attempt to avoid a tyranny of the majority we've got a tyranny of the minority. That's not what the framers wanted and it's not something we should settle for. ,
Yeah for sure. For them this is basically the least bad way to lose considering where they found themselves this evening. Like you say Republicans are generally really good at spin and messaging. They can jujitsu this loss into some red meat for their base and regroup on their own terms. I'm sure there will be additional attempts at repeal before the midterms.As for McCain the idea of a return to bipartisanship and normalcy is just a hopeful longshot but honestly what else does the guy have at this point? With one action he helped his party walk away from an unmitigated disaster with only minor injuries and in a tiny little way might have helped create a small opening for sanity. There's basically no chance of it working out but still at least it's a mildly constructive step. ,
Maybe but it's a compelling theory given that these people are so often viewing everything through the lens of how it will affect their next election and it's not like they weren't clear that they were voting on some kind of "repeal and replace later" act that would still be scored at a net loss of coverage for many millions of people.There are a number of GOP Senators who have made overtures suggesting that they don't like certain policy directions their party has taken but their are repercussions for breaking with them when it comes down to voting.I'm vainly going to hope that McCain's diagnosis will remove his own view that he needs to constantly defend his seat and maybe his actions will start to match his rhetoric. But like you said that might be far too generous.,
The mandate is necessary to make the pre-existing conditions clause work.You can't force insurers to cover everyone but not make everyone pay into the pool. Without the mandate healthy people don't pay and insurers have to shell out for people they know are going to be major liabilities to them.You can get rid of neither or both but one without the other makes zero sense and breaks the system but Republicans tried to do it because they don't know jack shit about policy anymore just that removing the pre-existing conditions rule would be political suicide and people don't like fees.,
>I think people should be forced to have health insurance and I think every employer should be forced to provide it. Honestly the need for employers to provide health insurance (well larger employers anyway) is one of the first things I'd axe if I were trying to reform the U.S. system as it stands now. It reduces employee mobility it places an extra burden on the self-employed it places a huge burden on any business that's looking to expand the tax exclusion granted to employers for providing it is insane and it's created all sorts of legal snarls over employers who have religious or philosophical objections to certain forms of health care (e.g. birth control). I can see why employer-provided health insurance became a thing when it did (mostly during WWII's wage freeze) but right now I'd argue that it creates more problems than it solves.,
I don't like the mandate because I don't like being penalized for being too poor to afford a premium. There are probably three months out of the year Christmas bonus time and tax return season where I could swing an entire premium payment. BUT I like the ACA and what it's done for people as a whole more than I don't like the mandate and I understand why it absolutely has to be there. It is unfortunate. I really really wish the government would just tax us and give us all insurance that actually covers things in return. I'm tired of either being uninsured and hoping I qualify for the self-pay discount or having a bare bones plan with a deductible so high I never actually see a payout. ,
After House & Senate agree on unified bill it moves to the President's desk to sign into law at which point normally he would veto it. Anyone can see this is making a mockery of the legislative process. Of course nothing matters anymore and Trump will blindly sign off on anything without even reading it.The other thing stopping bills from being passed is the supermajority requirement for cloture. The Senate can easily vote on the nuclear option a historic decision to just require simple majority to pass bills without filibuster. This is what McCain was railing against in his speech.Of course they can easily just use Reconciliation again to pass bills that happen to affect the budget with just a simple majority.We live in dangerous fucking times. This is what happens when one party controls both chambers and you have a president that's literally working in bad faith.,
As an Arizonan these. are the actions I support McCain on recently he has been more than willing to be steamrolled by Trump. However as independent I do think long lasting policy should be bipartisanship it's not good for America to have an administration willing to undermine the previous president. Of course Obamacare is broken in a lot of states and counties. But fixing something that we already have vs reapeadtly showing an inability to even repelar the most basic parts of Obamacare: this must truly be an embarrassment to trump though. His promises were HUGE and now he can't even 50 votes to even make it look like they're trying to push a bill that's just a travesty.,
That's exactly what happened. I got so much shit when I tried to tell people this a couple of days ago but no one would listen amid the hysteria over the motion to proceed.We knew neither the BCRA nor the AHCA had the votes to pass so it comes down to skinny repeal. And McCain promised he's not voting for a repeal without a replacement. And he lived up to his word. What's amazing here is he apparently managed to ambush McConnell at the last moment - they thought they had enough votes for a Mike Pence tie break again and now they got egg on their faces.,
Honestly I think it's a bit of both. I think he could have gone either way in the end but the news of his health likely made this more of a reality to him. Even if he isn't necessarily benefiting from the healthcare act I'm certain he now has a personal attachment to it.I genuinely owe him an apology too. I was aware of the 'yes' move and I did read that he was wanting to open the floor for debate but I figured that was just talk. I've just seen him hop back and forth so many times over the last 15 years that I'm wary of anything he says vs does. I'm happy he actually followed through and I'm sorry for doubting him; though I think the doubt was healthy doubt.,
It's really interesting to watch this over and over focussing on individuals. I think in the front of the GOP side is Marco Rubio? It looks like he moves slightly to his right to better see McCain's repsonse?And the older guy sitting towards the middle of the GOP on the very very left of the screen sort of head bowed no reaction at all to McCain's vote other than the interesting "finger steeple" he makes as McCain votes and relaxes as soon as he does. Almost an "I know this is coming yup there is was..." kind of thing.Of course I'm rpobably readng a helluva lot into this but it's still fun!,
You explained it better than I could have. Thanks!It says a lot that you got a bunch of Republican Senators like Graham get in front of the camera to say that they'll only vote yes for skinny repeal if Paul Ryan can GUARANTEE that it'll go to committee and Paul Ryan was essentially saying "Yea I guess we could if you really want that.."Going to the committee would start an endless cycle of the bill going further to the right or not enough to the right to keep the mega conservatives like the Freedom Caucus. If I remember correctly this was pretty much the Democrats's strategy because going to committee was just more time for Republicans to trash the ACA .Honestly the best part is that Senators knew they can't trust their House counterparts. Graham voted along party lines but McCain flipping his vote after Pence and McConnell tried to get his yes is a good indicator of how desperate they are for this win. So desperate that McConnell was selling bullshit was unicorn tears to the GOP senators of all spectrums. There was never any intention for Republican leadership to replace the ACA. Despite those votes they also never intended to repeal them since they were expecting Hilary to win. If there were doubts before that shitshow in the House should have confirmed it. But when this effort got to the Senate Republicans just realized they painted themselves into a corner. ,
All of the votes prior to the one last night were procedural to continue debating those particular bills. None of them were final votes. As a last ditch McConnell tried to end the debate quickly and push "skinny repeal" for a final vote. McCain stood up to his word and shot it down.Frankly I'm a little irritated with how the media has played this whole thing. In the past procedural votes would usually be completely unanimous as there's no harm in continuing debate. However if  he debate fails the bill fails so while votes for continued debate are not necessarily pro-bill votes votes against continued debate _are_ anti-bill votes. That nuance seems to be lost in most of the discussion I've seen.,
Thanks. It was huge. Having preventative care rather than emergency catastrophic care is the worst. Single payer isn't perfect either. I've lived in Australia before. Sure there are waiting periods for non urgent stuff but overall you can be seen fairly quickly and you can for the most part pick your doctor's or go anywhere without having to pay a dime. Specialists sometimes charge you $50 depending on how good they are. Hospital stays are free. What I did really like about it was that since the govt is footing all these bills they sure as hell give you the best damn preventative care you can get. When I was diagnosed with diabetes they gave me free consultations with a dietitian exercise person diabetes management consultant and a podiatrist to ensure my feet were doing well. It was amazing. In the states I would've ended up spending hundreds in copays and rack up my maximum out of pocket. ,
Because a decade ago when bills received automatic passage to the debate stage it was because they had already been extensively debated in committee the full text of the bill had been on display for weeks if not days and the policy discussion had already been had in the media. In short there was a bill that some parts of each side already believed in but the debate stage was for polishing it and rounding out the edges with amendments. In short a good portion maybe 80 to 90 % of the final bill was already written. That was anything but the case here. The bill was written at lunch on the day of not the vote to go to debate but the vote on the bill itself. The bill wasn't written let alone public when the vote to debate was taken. There was nothing to debate ,
He voted yes to open up this health care debate/vote-o-rama and then voted yes on the first vote related to the full repeal and replace plan (that one was voted down by 9 other Republican senators so his yes vote on that didn't matter in the end).  That was his first day back and everyone who was against the bill was understandably upset with him because his actions made it appear that he returned to toe the party line and help push the bill through (it was dead without him because of Murkowski and Collins).  Then he voted against the clean repeal and crucially cast the deciding vote against the skinny repeal last night so obviously the people who are against the bill are pleased with his most recent actions.,
Honest question: I was on healthcare last year but they dropped the plan and the next lowest offer was double the price. I decided to settle for the fines this year because it's cheaper in the long run and I'm one of those healthy people that never actually use the coverage for anything (and I was kind of selfishly hoping the fines would be repealed). The fine is supposed to increase every year though and it's already a strain on my finances so I'm wondering how long this is viable. Do you know of any good resources to look into plans that might not be advertised on the official state sites? My employer is too small to get anything through them and my state isn't that progressive or competent so I feel like I'm missing some options.,
It's a really complicated subject but I'll give you a quick summary. Basically pre-ACA insurers could impose lifetime caps and refuse coverage for anyone with a pre-existing condition. This obviously kept premiums lower because insurance companies needed to pay out fewer benefits (it's worth noting that premiums were still increasing at alarming rates pre-ACA). Post-ACA insurance companies would suddenly have a lot more sick people that they needed to cover. This was partially offset by the individual mandate which made healthy people buy insurance as well. (Some people see this as forcing healthy people to pay for poor sick people but that ignores the fact that we all paid for healthy people getting into accidents and going to the ER and sick people also using the ER in place of actual treatment because they couldn't get insurance. The mandate may seem like paying more but in the long term we'd all be paying less and would be healthier overall)So with a larger customer base insurance companies could cover the cost of treating the increase in new sick people by drawing premiums from a larger population while keeping individual premiums relatively low.The problem is insurance companies set premiums based on what they *think* they will need to pay out over the year. Because we had no idea what would happen post-ACA insurance companies needed to increase premiums in anticipation of higher costs.To offset this Obamacare originally included a provision by which any insurance companies that made a profit would give some money to a pool that would go to compensate companies that lost money. Federal subsidies would cover the difference. With this companies wouldn't have to worry about losing a lot of money because they didn't increase premiums. This provision was supposed to sunset in 2016 when insurance companies would have enough information to lower premiums to what they actually needed. That was the "risk corridor".Marco Rubio eliminated that safety net. Companies panicked and jacked up premiums because they had no fallback if they couldn't cover their costs. [Turns out as of 2016](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-cms-risk-report-20170703-story.html) the companies know what they need to charge now and have reported that the markets are stabilizing just as was anticipated in the original ACA.**So why haven't premiums gone down?**Because since the passage of the ACA Republicans have fought tooth and nail to sabotage it. They fought it in the Supreme Court to get the power to turn down the Medicaid expansion. They threatened to defund the regulations and the CSR program. Now that Trump is in power the constant efforts to repeal the ACA have forced insurance companies which work by planning for an inherently uncertain future to pull out of exchanges and increase premiums under the assumption that they wouldn't be reimbursed by the Government. [(This is what Trump meant when he would "let Obamacare fail"- he was going to order HHS to end Government support for the ACA and cause companies to suddenly lose massive amounts of money and crash the market).](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-obamacare-csr-payments-insurance-companies-2017-4)Obamacare needs a lot of fixes but the major problems with premiums are the constant threats to the health insurance market by Congress and the GOP and constant interruptions of cooperation between the Government and the insurance industry by politicians looking for political ammunition.I'm sorry if you're struggling to pay for insurance. Obamacare is far from perfect and no one in this country should be in that situation.,
And if you or your kids get sick and need help you can't afford? Before the ACA it was common for plans to have a maximum pay out for the Insurance Company not for you.So what do you think would have happens if you got hit by a car or got cancer yourself and need significant rehabilitation or treatment to be able to work again?You'd be shit out of luck and hoping disability payments would cover your families living expenses. (They probaly won't of health insurance is too much with your jobs income unless you are working a very low wage)If you honestly can't afford to feed your children solely because of the cost of health insurance let me know and I'll help you make a budget and apply for food assistance.Or you could cancel your insurance Trump told the IRS not to fine people for not having it.If you are willing to gamble with your families lives like you are willing to gamble with other people's families just cancel your insurance.If you want Insurance for your family then you have to pay the share of the costs the insurance company decides you can handle. Don't like corporations deciding that? Single payer is the way to go.It's sad that as the most wealthy nation in the world we won't cover health costs like every other developed nation does. There is no reason any America needs to die of preventable illnesses or go hungry. ,
Yes it would have been a significant hike for the (lower?) middle-class that bought on the exchanges with hikes of 20% or more at the very least.Still compare that to the old version. It was essentially 800billion worse.Old Trumpcare would have gutted Medicaid hitting the poor primarily. They would have changed the ACA rules so insurance no longer had to cover many essential health benefit. That was their main trick to keeping premiums down with all the money they were pulling out. You still would have had insurance but it would no longer cover many things (no ambulance rides not all maternity care not all emergency sarvices signifiantly reduced mental health care coverage significantly less rehabilative care pediatric oral/vision care etc).This skinny repeal was already much much less of a nightmare. Still it would have been worse than the status quo.,
I am not saying it was in any way better than the status quo just that is was already a big retreat by the Republicans.It is also a bit misleading to compare the 22/21 million losing insurance to 16 million losing insurance for skinny repeal (as scored) straight up. The first number mostly includes the poor who have no recourse at all if they then get sick. The latter number includes many people who do have some options still. People who have income and were buying on the exchanges. It also includes those who voluntarily drop their insurance (no individual mandate) even if I think that is a poor choice.The effective "meanness" of the bill was not 5:4.It also doesn't even deal with how the old approach significantly worsens insurance coverage even when you got it. They would have changed the ACA rules so insurance no longer had to cover many **essential health benefits**. That was their main trick to keeping premiums down with all the money they were pulling out. You still would have had insurance but it would no longer cover many things (no ambulance rides not all maternity care not all emergency sarvices signifiantly reduced mental health care coverage significantly less rehabilative care pediatric oral/vision care etc). All of that was no longer an issue with skinny repeal.This skinny repeal was already much much less of a nightmare overall. (My totally pulled out of my ass *'meanness score'* is **10** for the old version **3** for skinny repeal.) Still it would have been worse than the status quo.,
>  keep these kind of power hungry men out of our own countryWhen the CIA and FBI start torturing American citizens and enemies of the oligarchs - then you'll be doing this. ~~As bad as Republicans and Trump might be - as bad as lobbyism is - these agents still do not physically torture people in the ways Russians are doing in Browders' testimony.~~Edit: I was wrong - American agents have used similar methods as the KGB.I don't want to play the victim here obviously but as bad as it might get in America you'll never have this threat looming over you unless your own state in decades goes down this road. For us? That threat exists about 300 km to the east from my current location - the threat of torture and extremelly painful state-sanctioned murder. ,
They can reintroduce it but they know they won't get the votes.  And trying and failing again won't have the same sort of 'noble failure' that it did when they were voting to repeal the ACA during Obama's term.  Republicans are in the majority so the average citizen feels like they should be able to be able to pass bills successfully and repeated failures would just make them look bad.By letting this go through debate on the floor of the Senate and then having a vote on the passage of the bill there is no wiggle room to spin this.  It wasn't defeated on procedure or by some sort of parliamentary rule.  Trump can't complain that it wasn't put up for debate or that 'the Dems' wouldn't let it be voted on.  It was defeated when the entire US Senate was asked "do you want this bill to pass and become law?" and more than half of them said "**NAY**".,
There are different co-pays. Some are for medicine some are for doctor visits.The trouble is that when doctors negotiate with insurance companies they end up at a higher price. Then the insurance ends up having a high deductible (which you have to pay out of pocket before insurance covers more of the healthcare cost). So it comes out to: if I pay cash (or CC or check) to the doctor directly for a visit it will cost $100 (example); if I go with my insurance it will cost me $200.EDIT: as far as conservatives you have to remember that they want to go back to a time when there were fewer people less taxes and everyone was on their own. 100 years ago there was no income tax in US.,
Good article!It actually says a bunch of good thing on our system. But you are right the finance of it should be adressed. That system is based on a lot of young healthy people and less older people. the way it was after WW2 when that program started. My personal opinion is that we need more tax to support the changing demographic. But that might be only me. The public deficit of healtcare is a national jokes. The jokes being that that particular hole is NOT so big compared to fiscal fraud or what the country had to pay to refund Credit Lyonais or BNP Paripas. ( to put thing in perspective )So yeah. It cost money to have good healthcare. Big woops. Let's find it then rather than sold everything to the private sector. ( hint: Macro will just do that sell the whole thing ... sad )I would be ok with the mostly private US system if it was not so freaking wasteful and and scam overall.* ( source on that at the bottom ) You guys are overcharged at every step in the way for subpar quality care. It's a bit sad to witness: People being afraid to go to Urgent Care or use EMS while in obvious need of it was a bit of a shock to me in a western country. My personal experience in the US is limited :  paying $250/month (+ 250 from my employer ) for a subpar plan. Basically covering not much unless major shit hit the fan. ---And talking about debt and future generation... It's crazy how credit is central in the US society. I'm was socked to learn that most people I know have massive student/medical debt. And the existence of the credit score is a bit un-settling too. Having to contract credit to have a credit score so you can rent a place. Don't you find that weird? I never contracted a credit in my life... I might to buy a house at some point but I'm trying to avoid that. Anyhoo I digress. Here is a good resource about healthcare as well. https://www.uta.edu/faculty/story/2311/Misc/2013226MedicalCostsDemandAndGreed.pdfHave a nice day,
But you don't understand. If he respected the system he didn't have that chance. The senate has a political responsibility to debate with full fairness bills which reach the floor. McCain killing it before it "has a chance" isn't admirable whatsoever. Your reaction would be entirely different if a republican had blocked the ACA as it hit the debate floor.The rest of this is just loaded with petty statements founded on political disagreements with McCain. I'm clearly not going to get anywhere with you if you can't see that your political views =/= necessary and objective vaults to social progress.>If you want to accept "proper order" as "no consequences for your past record so long as you throw us a bone now and then" there a few dozen banana republics that will be happy to have you.You mis-understand. Banana republics hate open debate they hate proper political frameworks which curb absolute power founded on arbitrary whims of a single individual. You'd be far more welcome over there as a vigorous campaigner against civil debate :),
It wouldn't they would just all move to the states with the highest monthly rates allowable. The problem when you treat something so inherently regulated like health as a commodity is that you force a significant amount of people to get treated and then run for it or just not get treated at all.Why are premiums so high? Because the hospital has a large portion of patients that cannot for health insurance or afford their sugery but they can still make it to the emergency room to be treated anyways. So when the hospital needs to collect there's no money there to pick up. To compensate the hospital charges people that can pay to pay more and then premiums rise because those people cost money for their health insurance.Why do your health insurance costs greatly exceed that of Europe and other parts of the world? Precisely because we have a market as currently. Drug companies lobby to get higher costs for drugs here that they sometimes sell at a loss abroad because the free market dictates our health system - supply here is miniscule and demand is exorbitant so prices are extremely high. In order for you to have your drugs either you or your insurance company has to be willing to pay for this (if you have a pre existing condition clause in your health insurance then you are also the one that has to pay for it). In other countries these drugs are government regulated.Usually that means a lot of drugs are sold here first or whatever but drugs do cost a lot because of how much risk is entailed when making them to pass all the FDA regulations (very important to our national health): over 99% of drugs being made get cut somewhere in the process and that drug that didnt go anywhere is just a loss for the drug company.The discussion about this has been happening for years but single payer is effective for a nation as proven time and time again not so much for a corporation. Realistically republicans should be fighting to make corporations have a lower risk in the market rather than fighting for all of us to be fucked by some rando corp.The individual mandate is required if no pre existing conditions because otherwise all insurance companies would operate at a loss since no one would get insurance till they needed it; pre existing buffers this because you cant get treatment for diseases you had prior to being apart of the insurance policy.,
The problem with health insurance companies is inherent and cannot be fixed. Health care should never turn enough of a profit to sustain megacorporations. The problem you run into when you privatize health care is the shareholder/public corporation problem. That institutions goal is not to provide affordable health insurance or to serve it's beneficiaries well and with a reasonable cost it's goal is to maximize profits for it's shareholders. Health care should be about making (and keeping) people healthy not money and as long as we allow health insurance companies to exist in their current form the worse this will get.,
My understanding of the limits from doing the research about how this will affect my life if it gets passed is that the limits previously came in two flavors...annual and lifetime; generally $500k and $1-2MM respectively.  Even if it is just annual had a limit kicked in while we were in the middle of our NICU stay my wife and I would have had to have relied on charity from the hospital to write off the remaining balance or our emergency fund and all of our savings would have been wiped out and we would have been one of the financially responsible couples that declare medical bankruptcy every year despite being covered by insurance.  I seriously doubt they would have discharged us just because we ran out of coverage.I appreciate the factual outline of the proposed law.  All I am trying to is provide a bit of context for people to evaluate each element themselves.  ,
>Gerrymandering is done by both parties and only has an impact on House racesThe first part is true though only the democrats have really put forward legislation to provide for a neutral entity drawing districts. But beyond that your second point that gerrymandering only impacts House races isn't quite right.  Sure on it's face the direct effect is the determination of which voters get to pick which Congresspeople.  But for more moderate politicians in solid districts get pressured to adopt more extreme positions to satisfy the portion of their base that actually votes in primaries.  Over time the politicians in solid districts end up either moving towards the extreme themselves or get primaried by the someone willing to pander to the extreme parts of the base.  So the argument is that in short gerrymandering has a radicalizing effect on the the party as a whole.,
The GOP has impacted every level of federal state and local government with tools not just limited to gerrymandering. The GOP has access to more cash due to it's anti-tax and anti-regulatory philosophy. It uses that cash to run very effective fear- and hate-inducing campaigns especially in rural and suburban America. It can help fund more politicians' campaigns get their names and messages out there and gain control of elements like election boards. Over time the party has made voting more complicated and difficult by making sure more people are registered as felons make voting stations more scarce in urban settings make registering to vote a complicated process and for example create a nationwide voting investigatory body to subtly intimidate people from registering at all. If everyone voted in America I suspect the GOP's reach would be limited to rural areas and deep red states--not in control of the White House and Congress.,
At the moment a bit less than 10% of Senators represent around 50% of the US population. Meaning that 90% of Senators are representing the *other* 50% of the US population.A Senator from California represents around 16000000 people. A Senator from Wyoming represents around 250000 people.And yes I know that officially Senators represent states not people but that's my point. Due to the way states worked out we've got an absolutely insane and untenable over representation of the people in low population regions.As originally constructed the Senate was a deal to give excess power to the slave states in order to convince them to join the USA. Back then there wasn't as much variance in state populations the most populous state was Virginia simply because it was physically one of the largest and its climate was excellent for farming. Cities weren't even a blip on the radar as around 80% of the population lived on farms.But things change and today over half of the population is represented by under 10% of the Senate and that's a problem.It wouldn't be quite so much of a problem if the rural low population areas would treat their excess of power with a bit of humility and respect for the majority but they don't. The people from the rural low population areas seem hellbent on enacting policies designed explicitly to cause maximum pain harm and humiliation to the urban majority. It can't last. The rural states already get huge cash infusions from the urban centers and that's fine. But they seem unable to recognize the great gift they are getting and express the tiniest shred of gratitude instead they express hate and contempt for their urban benefactors and claim we aren't even real Americans.There's only so long most Americans will tolerate being dictated to by rural people who hate them and by sheer accident of history not numbers not economics have the political power to act on their hate.,
The fact that my state has one senator for every 600000 of our citizens and the way the voting rolls are distributed people are tossed off rolls Democrat areas have their election offices budgets cut and our most liberal city had to have hundreds of volunteers just to keep the polls open until late had to apply for an extension to stay open later. The GOP also removed same day registration and attempted to kill early voting. So yeah the GOP is doing a lot including gerrymandering to win elections unfairly. But winning is all that matters rules and fairness be damned. ,
Just as a sort of PSA but the vast majority of psychiatric diagnoses made by modern clinicians aren't any more subjective than those made in many other fields of medicine. While it was a huge problem in the past the field has made leaps and bounds in the last 50 years in terms of our understanding of all sorts of mental disorders as well as in the standardisation of how they are taught about and diagnosed. Of course there are a handful of very rare and tricky disorders such as schizoaffective disorder that often suffer from rather low inter-rater reliability but the same can be said of many rare illnesses that can be misdiagnosed by medical professionals due to factors like sharing a host of symptoms with a disease that is more common or more related to the field in which the doctor giving the diagnosis has the most expertise.In Donald Trump's case I don't think you'd find much variance at all in the diagnoses of professionals who would observe him. He's basically a textbook narcissist.,
> They could've done this without creating an undemocratic electoral college and senate. They could've just made a NATO alliance where all 50 independent states would vow to protect one another. An attack on one is an attack on all. That sort of thing.I think you're referring to the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation).  You know the first US constitution.  It had some issues so they called together a constitutional convention to amend it.  Instead they rewrote the entire thing.Incidentally that's why the idea of states calling a constitutional convention is so scary to people.  One of those can do anything to the constitution.  Given that single amendments to state constitutions are now longer than the entire US constitution that's not something most people are eager to see.,
The senate is not representative of the populous. It was never designed to be so. It is a *union* of states. It is very much **representative** of each state. The house is there for your arguments about democratic representation. I fail to see what your problem is. Is it a democratic body in the sense of representing the average voter? No. It never was meant to. But is it democratic in it's process? Yes it most obviously is. It is also very cleary **representative** of the intentions it was originally designed for. That is for the small and large states to have an equal say. You can bicker and moan all you wish about how as an individual you don't feel represented in the Senate but it was never for you. It is for these United States. ,
We were founded as a democratic republic not a pure democracy. And we kind of fought a war over the whole "let's allow states to form small independent unions" thing. Turns out people with the majority will allow for shitty things to happen to the minority so long as it's not happening to them if there is no federal oversight at all. Also I don't see why you are acting like the states have no independent power to legislate themselves. To the extent that their actions don't violate the constitution or federal law the states have pretty substantial ability to legislate themselves. If a state has a desire for a particular form of policy it can vote in a state legislature to promote those ideas and then implement them. It is not as if the state government is incapable of implementing any social program or liberal policies. If Californians want to healthcare for all great I hope it works and expands from there. Colorado wants to legalize pot go ahead lead the way. State governments are supposed to be vehicle for local governance and target the issues particular to the community. The federal government is supposed to be responsible for those changes that will impact the entire nation which is why every state is entitled to have its voice heard. ,
Oh I agree that the failure and intentional bridling of the house is an affront to our founding democratic process. As far as your second point I'd counter that in as much as the the Senate is unfair to populous states the house is unfair to remotely populated stated. Or at least it's supposed to be. I fully acknowledge the house's current failures to do so. The Senate isn't supposed to be some sort of secondary house legislature. It's supposed to represent the states in as much as we are a union of states. I understand that may not mean as much since the Civil War but it still very much means something to a great many people. ,
He sure is but she's voted in Gorsuch and helped remove the filibuster for Supreme Court justice appointments. She voted in Betsy (voted her past committee in trade for getting to vote no on the main vote). She's also voted [this jackass](http://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-judicial-pick-john-bush-lies-to-the-senate-about-comparing-abortion-to-slavery) into a power seat and quite a few other jerk offs. She's done what Joe would have done except now on healthcare. It's just not good enough. They will find a way to bribe her. Betsy bought her way through and so have others. She will bend hard right when the right incentives are there. Remember waving bye to net neutrality and having isps sell your data? [Look who said "Yea".](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00094)[Wonder why that was such an easy vote for her...](https://www.adn.com/politics/article/gci-spends-big-alaska-senate-race/2010/12/07/)Anyway what I'm saying is that she isn't worth your vote. We need someone new badly. She is worth calling every day for this healthcare thing and what ever new horrors the Trump administration dreams up. At least that's working with what we've got.  ,
So I think McCain might have pulled the wool over McConnell.How I see it is McConnell  wouldn't have gone to the  floor unless he knew he had the votes. He the first two would fail but this gives people cover. They can say that while the third option wasn't their favorite of the three it their favorite didn't get the votes so the third option was their last. McConnell thought it would be 50-50 with pence casting the deciding vote; Collins and Murkowsk had obviously been given the go ahead to vote no every time. And then McCain goes behind McConnells back and votes no. ,
I expect we will see further analysis on this in the coming days but I'm not convinced that was his reasoning and I have yet to see proof that the procedural vote to open debate was the single specific onus for the loss of reconciliation (though I would like to!)It was pretty obviously not in danger of passing without his involvement and continued delays had already cost them the ability to pass elements of the bill through reconciliation. Senate Republicans were getting ready to move on from this a week ago before the most recent flurry of activity and his votes on the earlier versions didn't show much concern overtly disastrous policy a la the Cruz amendment ,
The problem with that logic is the senate has a bunch of other business to do which can't be done during the budget reconciliation process (AKA the way you can pass stuff with a simple majority rather than 60 votes ).Bills can only be passed via reconciliation once a year. So if McCain had killed the MTP none of this theater tonight would've happened. They would've had to return to regular order (which is what he pleaded for in his ~15m speech on the floor the other day) so they could get to things like appointments and the NDAA.His Yea vote on the MTP prolonged the reconciliation process (again the *exact opposite of what he called for in his floor speech immediately preceding said vote*) and led us to where we were tonight. He could've stopped the whole thing. Murkowski and Collins both voted to do so. He didn't. THAT is why people were pissed - because his vote vs. his speech was hypocritical and inconsistent as hell.,
> All of the votes prior to the one last night were procedural to continue debating those particular bills. None of them were final votes. As a last ditch McConnell tried to end the debate quickly and push "skinny repeal" for a final vote. McCain stood up to his word and shot it down.Thanks for the clarification! I can't help but think those might as well be final votes simply because of the way McConnell has written the legislation - completely in secret. I didn't see any amendment making it into the BCRA if the GOP wants it to go to the House with 51 votes. The GOP being in the position that they are - basically paralyzed and dependent on repeal/replace ACA to enact their other initiatives - I don't see the final votes for those proposals deviating from the procedural ones except maybe with Rand Paul who cast his vote along GOP lines as an independent and really wanted to repeal MORE of the ACA if not all of it.,
Best suggestion for you is to go through https://www.healthcare.gov/ and see what it says. You don't *have* to get insurance through your employment and you might be entitled to a really big subsidy depending. If your income is low enough you may have several options. In 2015 I was under the poverty line and I got a really nice subsidized Silver plan for $97/month. It was subsidized by the federal government because my income was so low.You could also qualify for expanded Medicare if [your state](http://familiesusa.org/product/50-state-look-medicaid-expansion) chose to expand it. Your income has to be under 138% of the Federal poverty line. If your income is too high your options are much more limited. You'd be part of the middle class which is the group that gets screwed the most by the medical system. They're the group that make enough money that they won't *literally starve* when paying high fees but the lower-middle-class will end up paying a huge fraction of their income.You can also call a professional insurance agent and see if there's anything you can do. I know a good one in Utah if you happen to be from here. ,
> they aren't going to go through the process and risk looking foolish.What count are we at for them calling a vote and failing? 4 times? They aren't scared about looking foolish they have their marching orders and they say "repeal the ACA [or else](http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/06/26/gop-donors-close-checkbooks-frustrated-with-lack-progress-on-taxes-health-care.html)"  > At least one influential donor Doug Deason has told congressional Republicans that he is withholding funds until he sees major action on health care and taxes. The Texas-based donor has already refused to host a fundraiser for two members of Congress and informed House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. his checkbook is closed as well.> "Get Obamacare repealed and replaced get tax reform passed" Deason said in a pointed message to GOP leaders. "You control the Senate. You control the House. You have the presidency. There's no reason you can't get this done. Get it done and we'll open it back up."    ----Look -- I'm glad this shit failed trust me. I've sent my Senator (Graham) an e-mail detailing my disgust for his support of this farce.   But it's obvious that the GOP as a whole do not give a shit for Americans who don't fill their coffers.   The option to repeal the ACA shouldn't even be on the floor without a solid plan to **improve** it. They've had over seven years to attempt to do and this is what we get: nothing.  In the following days I'm sure we'll see insults hurled at Democrats and those Republicans who voted 'No'.   Sorry it's late and this shit has my blood up.,
This is the problem with our political system (and politics in general). You think they're on the wrong side because you don't agree with their opinions. What makes your side the right one? There are millions of people who think that your side is actually the wrong side. There shouldn't be a right and wrong because in politics there are pros and cons to every single thing and nothing is going to be good for everyone. It's all opinions and I don't think that "right and wrong" are the terms that should be used. Now you did specify that it was wrong for you which is good because you're at least admitting that this context applies to you personally but not necessarily everyone but it's still dangerous territory imo. I think that once you start saying that one side is wrong people start to lose sight of the issues and instead only care about beating their opposition because "they're wrong" no matter the issue or consequences. It would be nice if there were no parties at all. There are a lot of things where I agree with the democrats and a lot of things where I agree with the republicans :/. Pretty much every policy seems to be a lesser of two evils type of thing though.,
the system of congress was largely copied from england but the idea of making freedom and 1st amendment the most precious thing next to 2nd amendment and having states rights and real democracy was americapeople who came to america were often FLEEING europe - now we see young liberals who want to either go to europe or make america europeamerica needs to do everything AMERICA way - america is plenty capable of compassion and is actually most philanthropic - but we need to do it with private marketplaces in mind we cant just copy cat someplace in europe since europe has always been about something else than us and that will never change,
How many times do we have to repeat it. Obamacare isn't the end of the healthcare debate. We aren't elated that this is what it's gonna be like for the rest of our lives we are happy that we got a step forward. We are happy that it didn't get repealed because that would be starting all over again. Jesus you got your head so far up your countries ass that you don't realize it isn't as easy to implement universal healthcare as you think it is. We have people with hands deep in the industries pockets actively fighting it. This has nothing to do with your country so why don't you take your superiority complex somewhere else.,
>. The senate has a political responsibility to debate with full fairness bills which reach the floor. Are you going to tell me with a straight face that "debate with full fairness" is what took place in the Senate between Tuesday and Thursday? If so I call you a liar.I came to the US escaping a banana republic. Don't even try to lecture me on how they work. They're all about appearances and ceremony even when one legislative body has been neutered. Salaries to lawmakers continue to be paid (bonuses included!) and everybody keeps going through the motions because no matter how terrible the despot respectability politics are too deeply ingrained in modern politicians and they're perfectly capable of holding a 10-hour debate with their headsman about the direction the axe will slice their neck from. Do you believe it's impossible for the United States to descend into that? It takes time but empires fall. And most often they rot from the inside. Because the letter of the law is held sacrosanct over its meaning until the latter is lost forever. By all means keep heaping praise on John McCain for at long last finally keeping his word and disregard every dishonest step he took on the way there. See you in 2024 when you're discussing how "presidential" President Cruz is acting by not outright banning Islam.,
Here's the problem with trying to compare The MHR with the ACA.Massachusetts is one of the wealthier states in the nation and when the MHR was passed most were already covered by employer-sponsored health coverage with many more already on Medicaid.  The amount of uninsured was minuscule in comparison to those insured.  The MHR was designed specifically with Massachusetts unique circumstances in mind and THAT is why it worked there.Trying to copy/paste what the MHR did and apply it to the whole nation is another ball game entirely.  As Romney himself said "A plan crafted to fit the unique circumstances of a single state should not be grafted onto the entire country."  Obama basically looked at a square peg in a square hole and said "I bet I can make that fit every single hole no matter what shape it's in.",
John McCain is a bit of a mixxed bag. On the one hand he is (relatively speaking) a fairly moderate GOPer so I like that (I prefer the middle ground) . On the other hand its his fault the Tea Party ever got a national stage (Damn it Palin). On the good hand he's a veteran and a war hero and I respect that. One the bad hand he is "concerned" about a large number of things that he votes to allow to happen. Good hand he's one of the few Senators calling Trump on his shit. Bad hand he's helping with this reconcilliation bullshit.I respect the way John McCain ran his presidential race in '08 even if the RNC was brutal and Palin was an albatross around McCain's neck. I think this sub jumps back a forth based on how helpful McCain is being to the Progressive cause which is bad. If the sub can get back to the middle and be a haven for open discussion I'd appreciate it. ,
> So the argument is that in short gerrymandering has a radicalizing effect on the the party as a whole.It doesn't though.  I lived in Illinois for the 37 years.  I lived in the 17th Congressional district which is 100% gerrymandered to keep Democrats there.  The impact of that seat had zero impact on the Senate races because the State is controlled by what Chicago does which is also nearly 100% Democrat.It never radicalized anything to be honest.This is all an exercise in people looking to place blame on something else instead of accepting how things are.  Reagan left the Democrat party (even though he was a Democrat for 50 years) because policies changed.We are just in a state of flux in the United States right now.  Where one group is pushing for more European style of government and the other wants less restriction on people and their money.And in the middle we have two parties the beltway democrats and beltway republicans that don't give a damn about the people and are only in power for themselves.  These are the people that added $15 trillion in debt in the past 11 years.,
Because states get Senators and territories/districts don't? The Constitution lays that out pretty plainly. And again DC isn't the only place in the US affected. The current system is based on the constitution not some "principle of Democracy". Change the constitution get the votes to make them a state. Until then it's just how the law is. (And they've been debating those options for pretty much the entire existence of D.C.). "Why does it matter if they are a state?" Is honestly a silly question being a state is the *only* thing that matters in the US regarding senate representation at the moment.And that's ignoring other constitutional issues like it might not be as simple as declaring them a state it might take an amendment. But the argument has been going on for 200+ years so it's not like it's a Republican/Democrat issue. It's been a fundamental problem for centuries. ,
I'm sorry but no. You're living in a fantasy world. The leader of the GOP is referring to undocumented immigrants as animals. He's talking about how gangs of them are slicing up white teenage girls because they want them to suffer. And his base is just as crazy. Nearly half of Trump voters believe he won the popular vote. Republicans believe we have unprecedented immigration refugees are unvetted terrorits climate change isn't real undocumented immigrants live off of welfare and a whole host of other nonsense. How do you want to "come together" with a bunch of people who believe stuff that simply isn't true? And when you produce evidence that contradicts their beliefs as I have to many it gets dismissed as being fake.And the leadership is unbelievably cynical and disingenuous. McConnell has been attacking Obamacare from the left for years they all have. They complain too many people are left with no coverage they complain premiums too high when in reality they have no plan to fix those things. Those aren't even the things they dislike about Obamacare. They dislike the taxes and regulations. On Twitter last night I saw one person who was furious with McCain over his no vote. He said McCain should have had to have his surgery at an Obamacare clinic. What the fuck is an Obamacare clinic? My mom is a lifelong Republican and posts on Facebook about Obamacare. It's clear she has absolutely no idea what the bill did and she's not alone. There's no "coming together" with people who don't live in the real world.There is a recalcitrant white minority in this country fueled by resentment. They won't be bargained with or bullied. They have to be defeated at the polls period. Obama made a good faith effort at bipartisan healthcare reform and he was rebuffed. Trump and McConnell made a bad faith effort to undo that reform lied to the public about it the whole way then failed and blamed Democrats *who the GOP was explicitly trying to exclude*. Good luck coming together.,
>Professionals HAVE broke their ethical obligation by diagnosing Trump as a danger to the US. It was a consensus.Think about that statement for a second. Of people who broke their ethical obligation all agreed he was a danger to the US. Well...yeah? Duh? Would you break your ethical obligation to dissent? By the inherent nature of their sharing their position we know they are politically motivated.Trump is an asshole Trump is a danger to the US Trump very probably has some sort of mental illness. But you're not sampling from an unbiased dataset here. That kind of conclusion has no intellectual integrity.,
Yeah but we can't immediatly assume the cop is guilty. We should still follow proper procedures(which are made harder by the fact that most police view themselves as on the same team). Two wrongs don't make a right. Rather than being hot headed and screaming for his head we try to reform the whole police. That's the proper thing to do and the only way to actually solve the problem. Creating a war between BLM and the police will never help with anything. And like in any war both sides are at fault. With different degrees obviously. And with Trump we have a million legitimate things to attack him with. The first thing being that he's a fucking moron with ample evidence to that from his speeches tweets etc. No aditional attack is needed but we also have those ready. No need to make assumptions  ,
That's not it. This is what McCain said about his vote:>“I’ve stated time and time again that one of the major failures of Obamacare was that it was rammed through Congress by Democrats on a strict party-line basis without a single Republican vote” he said in a statement explaining his vote. “We should not make the mistakes of the past.”This entire process has been ramming things through. Hell the last few days in particular gave them *20 hours* to put together a bill and vote on it. No matter how he voted on whatever bill it would have been in an extremely fast time frame very little public transparency and he even voted YES on bill of the three that came up for a vote.We were paying attention. We did understand the nuance. And McCain had made himself extremely unreliable with several chances to have stopped the whole thing cold prior to this vote-a-rama bullshit. Don't sit back in hindsight and deride people for things that were in no way clear and *still* don't actually line up with the man's words.,
I am quite sure John McCain knows orders of magnitude more both about this bill and about how much debate is standard or productive in the Senate before deciding on how to vote than either of us. :) I don't think he should be crucified (as he was on this sub) for a position that has its downsides but is at least logically coherent (as wanting to debate a subject you already have a stance on is quite reasonable).Additionally Democrats were *very* quick to point out how this bill was being negotiated in secret without much debate. I don't think it's that farfetched that McCain could have earnestly wanted more debate on the subject and voted accordingly.,
I live in Texas. My income at the time I applied was $10800 for the year too low for the tax credit and my monthly income was too high for Medicaid. My son has CHIP and my fiance had insurance through his job at the time which he's since opted out of because it's too expensive. So I was only trying to get myself covered. The most affordable option I had was $208 premium $8000 (I think it could have been $6000) deductible. Hopefully this will all be moot because the job I just got offers insurance to full-time employees. I don't know if I'll be able to afford it but my fingers are crossed. If it's too expensive I'll be re-applying on the marketplace to see if things have changed.,
You know what's bad? I could actually see this fucking happening. I have VA benefits but I hated driving to the VA every time I needed to get something done and have to wait a few weeks for an appointment. So I went and got a private plan just so I could go to the doc closer to me. My bill with just me on it went up almost 1000% and I had to drop it I wasn't gonna pay $1488 a month from the $130ish I was paying and I wasn't the only one this one girl her premium went from $200 a month at her work to over $900 and she fucking worked in a hospital as a tech making life $1200-1300 a month if she was lucky.,
Only a majority of the *hand-appointed conferees* (by each House leader) is required to validate a conference report for the president to sign. It doesn't require a revote from the full senate/house of reps.This is usually not a problem because either House Senate or Executive would object to such sweeping amendments in a conference report. They have all 3 and all are willing to vote blindly.At this point you might be thinking "no way Republicans will do that."http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/27/politics/paul-ryan-conference-committee/index.html>Pressed by a group of Senate GOP members with an unusual request of guaranteeing the House won't vote on the bill they could pass in the early morning hours Ryan pledged if that's what it takes he was on board.>"Senators have made clear that this is an effort to keep the process alive not to make law. If moving forward requires a conference committee that is something the House is willing to do" the speaker said in a written statement Thursday night.>But Ryan had a demand of his own insisting the Senate had to come up with something it could get through saying "we expect the Senate to act first on whatever the conference committee produces." And he didn't specifically state what some Senate Republicans wanted him to guarantee -- that the House would never take up just the "skinny repeal.">**His comments followed several Republican senators who said earlier Thursday that they wouldn't vote for a so-called "skinny" health care bill unless if went to conference committee for changes. That plan appeared to have the support to pass the Senate.**>Already many House conservatives are signaling they don't want to just vote on the stripped down Senate Republican bill.>**On Thursday a number of Senate Republicans said the leadership strategy now behind moving ahead with the skinny proposal was mainly to move onto another stage of discussing a final bill with their House counterparts. In an unusual twist many senators were openly saying they didn't want the House to pass their bill but instead they just viewed the measure as a vehicle to punt on finalizing the details later.**,
If McCain had voted no for the measure to bring the bill to the floor for a vote McConnell could've just delayed the vote again and started this shit all over again a week or so later. We'd still be in the same situation where only 50 votes are needed to pass this turd.McCain voted to bring the bill up for a vote fooling McConnell into thinking McCain supported it. What McCain was actually doing was making the vote happen so he could kill the bill and make it any future healthcare bill the Senate proposed will need 60 votes.,
Republicans in the Senate don't have 60 votes to repeal Obamacare on their own. Instead they have to rely on a process called "reconciliation" which is passing the Senate's version of a bill originally passed by the House. There are some additional requirements to passing bills this way but it only takes 50 votes.The latest drama began with a "motion to proceed" a couple of days ago which is basically putting the bill up on the floor of the Senate for debates and votes. This also only takes 50 votes. McCain flew from the hospital to cast the deciding 50th vote the motion which provoked the widespread outrage you no doubt saw.However if McCain stayed home McConnell could just go back into the backrooms and arm twist someone into voting for it. Or if McCain were to from his brain cancer Arizona could appoint a party line Republican temp. Of course that won't necessarily happen any time soon but then again who knows?So instead he votes for the motion which means the Senate will now debate and vote on the three repeal options. But GOP's 52 senators aren't united. Collns and Murkowaski don't seem to want any repeal. Capito Alexander etc want repeal and replace but not repeal and delay. Moran Corker etc want repeal and delay but not repeal and replace.Basically even before the motion to proceed passed people tracking the Senators realized that both repeal-and-replace and repeal-and-delay only have the support of 40-something Senators. And predictably enough both failed.This brings us to skinny repeal which is McConnell's real goal. This has support from the most GOP senators. Senators like Heller want to vote for it to avoid having to vote for the BCRA or the AHCA. Conversely others would vote for it in the hopes that it'll turn into the BCRA or AHCA in the end. Ostensibly it seemed the GOP had this in the bags.What everyone forgot is that McCain vowed he won't vote for a repeal only plan. And a skinny repeal is still a repeal only plan. And he voted no.So the Obamacare repeal effort crashed and burned. All three plans for reconciliation failed. If the Republicans want to pursue Obamacare repeal they have to do it normally which requires 60 votes which they don't have.,
If you don't think that wishing death and cancer upon people has an effect you should pick up a psychology or sociology book or a history book. There has not been a single campaign of violence in history that did not predicate upon dehumanizing rhetoric against the enemy. It's a type of self-perpetuating polarization a thought virus that preys upon the evolutionary flaws in the human psyche. I'm not saying that these wishes for cancer are going to be followed by bloodshed but I am saying that in the broken and polarized landscape of modern American politics there is quite literally zero benefit for anyone and a lot of potential harm in choosing to dehumanize the other side.,
One of the crazy unfair things about the U.S. electoral system is that the way we do things gives the smallest states an outsized say not just in the Senate but also for the President and even the House (because the very smallest states have fewer than the average number per House member).In terms of presidential election I'd be very in favor of abolishing the electoral colleges in favor of a country-wide ranked popular vote. The legislature is a lot harder to fix (I mean both are practically impossible but to even conceptualize fixing). I think trying to give people in larger states fairer representation in some way would be great but I can't figure out the best way of doing so. I also think that it would be interesting to have at-large seats with people who are elected by the whole country and thus don't have the same local influences as others. It's important that local issues get channeled up into Congress but there also should be people who are responsible to the country as a whole making the laws.,
The biggest thing that bothers me about our 'Healthcare culture' is how everyone looks at healthcare as something thats thought about only in catastrophic circumstances. Its not the perfect analogy because of warranties and the fact most people replace and upgrade over time but..Your insurance on your car doesn't pay for your oil changes. Or for replacing tires that have worn down. I use my medical insurance at least twice a month for medications. If I were using my car insurance twice a month for anything id likely be denied coverage when I went renew.For how we go about and define all the non medical insurance business models out there looking at them and comparing it to what a human body needs and it just doesn't compute as something that should be labeled insurance.I am at a loss as to how to expand on this or make it more clear why it bothers me so much. But heh it was nice writing it out anyways.,
Oh I don't think he'll let it drop either.  But the fact is that they will have to make substantial changes.  They can't risk trying and failing again like this.  The Republicans need to at least come up with a healthcare bill which would be supported by all of the Republican Senators.Even if they can't get enough support for the next bill to break a filibuster they need a bill that would pass a straight vote.  At least then it would let the Republican leadership blame Democratic obstructionists for the bill's defeat.  Even if they can't win a vote they at least need a way to 'win' a propaganda victory by having a way to place blame for failure outside of their own party.  Losing on a straight vote because Republican Senators defected keeps all the blame for failure within the Republican Party.,
>we are happy that we got a step forward. Stop repeating this lie.Obamacare is not a step forward. Its more like a diagonal step backwards and to the side. Its just a different kind of awful. The only way democrats in America will realise this is by visiting other countries and learning how things work there.The unfortunate reality is that the only way for America to get single payer health care is to let Obamacare fail or dismantle it themselves. The only question is how many years of a death spiral are people prepared to put up with before demanding the democrats go 100% all-in for single payer.,
I work from home with things going in the background I'm literally getting paid while spending that time posting on reddit.Also I'm on a mission.The next time any of these people find themselves in a hospital to get some emergency IV codeine or quick surgery at a GP and receive a $5000 bill for something that takes half an hour they will think;>Wow this sucks why do I have to pay so much money despite having insurance?Then they will remember that they were so happy about their insurance and their deductibles they spent the night it was 'saved' preaching to random foreigners about how good it is.,
And I say yet again - the response to corrupt actors undermining the system isn't to advocate for MORE politicians to do the same just to further your own ends. That's how a system becomes irreparable.The debate was shoddy and the senators all entered with their votes in mind - does that mean you stop holding all debates in the future? No. You reflect on the issue and advocate for a return to the proper order. You continue having the debates and you encourage outcry whenever paper-thin debates are held. You advocate for reform of the system. As I said you're just throwing the baby out with the bath-water.Love the strawman at the end there. I already made clear I'm a leftist to the core. But this wouldn't be the first time you seemed convinced that anyone who *dared* disagree with your *divine* political views was down-right evil now would it?,
The idea that it is based on Republican or Democrat ideas I think is irrelevant.Thanks for the link.  Honestly it looks like Republicans were fine with ACA until they added in "individual mandate" and it was at that point they started blocking it.  Individual mandate is something Obama did not have when he campaigned.Theres also a New York Times article mentioned in what you linked that is defending indivdual mandate saying its a conservative idea which as a conservative is utter bullshit.  The federal government forcing the people to do something against their will is not conservative it is a socialist idea.And then Senate used an old House bill that had passed as a vehicle to get some proposals in? Thats extremely unethical in my opinion.Anyway bottom line is that while Obamacare was failing neither Ds or Rs worked together to improve it.I mean it cost like $1 billion for the market place website to be built out? Thats money laundering right there.Skip the above if you want my final point:It appears that Obamacare was put in place as a stepping stone to single payer.  As Ive commented before Rand Paul is the only person I trust to put good healthcare in place.  I hope Ds can take off their foil hats long enough to work with him on it.,
Honestly and I apologize but I don't have the energy right now. Like I said you made good points covering the positives of the bill and I appreciated reading it and seeing those points but for one the fact that no one HAS to buy into that failed bill or pay any kind of fine for not buying in would end up creating a worse problem from what I understand.I'm no expert though and you seem more informed than I am. That brings me to my point though you are probably more informed than most of the people who were voting yes on the bill. Thats an issue a huge issue for any policy/legislation no matter what topic its covering. ,
You are acting like its some unsolvable problem. The bill on the table is the simplest solution grant statehood to the residential area and shrink the district to just around federal buildings. All the fearmongering regarding the state having undue power or influence over the capital were the same arguments used regarding Maryland and Virginia centuries and yet neither of those states were denied suffrage. In terms of granting the land from Maryland there was no issue in granting DC land to Virginia in 1945.For more than a century it has been a partisan issue especially as the population grew and demographics were cemented. Its not a coincidence that they were granted electoral representation during the Civil Rights Movement. They are Americans they pay more than 22 other states in terms of taxes and have unequivocally voted for statehood among themselves. Their situation is completely dissimilar to Puerto Rico and Guam (who isnt even a commonwealth yet). Statehood for DC isnt some impossible goal. It is not constitutionally barred like you seem tl imply and is consistent with the legal framework therein.,
Yeah I think the country has to restructure either peacefully or through civil war. All the issues you have listed are not reasons that we should rule them with an iron fist rather they're irreconcilable differences that suggest that we should maybe go our separate ways. In a functioning democracy compromise is ideal. It's possible that we can win the hearts and minds of their base with an ironfist but we would need an absolute visionary to accomplish that feat and I don't think anyone in our country has the vision to unite this country through politics alone. Either way I prefer 60 votes to simple majority. Now that Republican's are now in power if they want to accomplish any sort of legislative agenda they will be forced to talk to Democrats after almost a decade of throwing a perpetual tantrum and refusing to play ball. I think the 60 votes is a healthy dose of reality for these fuckers and I would think it incredible awful if they repealed it. ,
My comments were obviously meant in jest  and I was making a joke in dry humor. I even put "/s with regards to the sound bites". Im curious about the source of your vitriol. Is it because you dislike his political opinions or because you think John McCain is actually more worthless than most politicians? He's had a long and stead career that's allowed him to build up significant political capital enough to vocally oppose a president from his own party.  The man isn't a maverick. If he was he probably would t have made it this long. It's entirely possible that no one will remember him after he dies but like I sad above "/s." Who would you consider to have had a legendary political career? ,
It is such only as much as we all agree to maintain our Union. States are allowed to pass their own laws. Even if they conflict with federal ones. It is not as if the majority does not have representation. They can wield it in their own state houses as well as the US House of Representatives. It is not by-in-large the fault of the system that people fail to vote for representation. I'll acknowledge valid criticisms about voter roll manipulations but the primary problem is people simply failing to go and vote. 60% of eligible voters actually placing a vote is a disgusting statistic and in many localities it is even lower. Your primary criticism should not lie with the Senate which has operated in more or less the same capacity for the past one hundred years. The way the House has operated is another discussion and one I feel is actually worthy of the vitriol tossed around this thread. But ultimately if you want change it should be with motivating people to actually utilize the rights this country gives them as citizens to go out and vote.  ,
That is irrelevant. That is the point of the Senate. The problem is in the house and it's lack of proper representation. The Senate is what it is supposed to be. I am as liberal as they come the PURPOSE of the Senate is to give the smallest states the same platform. If it were not for the Senate Vermont and Wyoming would have zero say in what happens nationally the STATE would have no representation. We ARE a collection of states we aren't just a country like many other countries. That is the point of the entire nation. ALL countries are just made up borders if you want to make that argument. The fact is that states tend to have common interests within them and that is the point of the Union to have a collection of various states all with their own individual ideals that have a say in how the Union is run. Not just have the biggest population centers making all the decisions. I don't agree with the EC but that is a separate issue. The Senate functions EXACTLY the way it is meant to and honestly the way it should. There are so many other things wrong with the way our government functions you really should be spending time lamenting rather than a FEATURE of the system (not a bug). Edit: also it would require an AMENDMENT to get rid of it. GOOD FUCKING LUCK WITH THAT.,
Yes I agree that the senate is rather undemocratic but the point I'm trying to make is that it was established specifically to fill such a role. Federal law will always trump state law to the extent the two are in conflict. In many areas however federal law generally just sets the floor not the ceiling. Most programs supported by myself and other liberals are progressive programs targeting expansion of government benefits increasing regulation and diminishing the massive inequality gaps between classes. In all these areas states have the opportunity to improve upon the floor set by the federal government. Such a process allows states to build programs tailored to serve their needs as opposed to trying to shoehorn every state within a federal plan that addresses the issue at a substandard matter. While I would certainly like for my views to be more heavily reflected in society than conservatives they are still entitled to a voice no matter how much I may disagree with it. As a voter I can have a larger impact by voting in my local elections and getting my state or community to adopt progressive plans and since I am aiming to only heighten the federal standard many times there will not be a conflict with federal law. It is simply false to claim that states do not have an ability to legislate themselves or implement progressive policies. While we should target political gerrymandering to prevent problems of disproportionate representation the tools are there. Again when the federal government is doing something and it will impact every state you should not ignore those in the minority. The system was designed so that states had significant power while federal solutions had to be widely accepted before being implemented. ,
Basically I agree but some of these people do care about national parks especially in the West. Out here they hike hunt and fish. That is an area where there can be some agreement.They also care about their families and agree on the need for single-payer health care.They are against NAFTA and other trade agreements and try to buy American.Some have historically been patriotic and although they don't believe their Lord & Master Trump was compromised by the Russians when you ask them why he doesn't just come clean and show his taxes like all other modern presidents they run out of excuses.I know some Trump voters. Out in the West it is my belief Bernie Sanders who encapsulated all those above mentioned values (and more that benefit working class) would have easily defeated Trump - by more than a mere 3 million!,
The Democrats are saying those things but usually with a bit of decorum.  Because unlike Trump and his cronies they still mostly believe in having a bit of it.As for the Republicans they're starting to sour on Trump the signs were all over the place this week.  His attacks on Jeff Sessions (IE "A member of the club") are turning them against him with a quickness.  If he goes through with it and fires Sessions Lindsay Graham wasn't kidding when he said there'll be "hell to pay."That's the kind of thing that might get even "R's" talking about impeachment.  While it galls me that it would be over Jeff Sessions of all people (whom I believe holds views I find reprehensible) it makes sense that the Republicans would finally budge when it comes to turning against their own...basically if Trump's not being loyal to the party the party's not going to be loyal to him.,
Okay I'm no expert on Congressional procedure but the link you provided shows the *exact opposite* of what you're claiming it shows. The fear was that if the Senate passed "skinny repeal" the House would hold a vote on the same exact bill and then forward it to the President as-is with zero changes. Like the other poster above you said if there were any changes to the bill whatsoever the changed bill would have had to pass another vote in the Senate before going to the President. A reconciliation conference committee can consider new amendments without getting a full chamber vote for each one but that does NOT mean they have the power to send any amended bill they want to the President.,
What made me really angry was how many people were literally wishing for his cancer to take him out quickly. I mean this no vote he cast was always the plan he made that clear from the get go and his heartfelt speech really did come from the heart. He wanted this BS repeal to fail. But just because he foresaw what happened tonight by initially voting to keep the debate going people took that as a sign that he was outright lying about everything and proceeded to call him a piece of shit over and over. So yeah apologies are in order but also maybe people should at least hold back a little until the pieces fall into place? ,
To his credit he even rallied after surgery and a brain cancer diagnosis to do it. How many of us would have gone into work to take care of business right after all that? Glad I held off jumping the gun to slam him after the initial vote. His speech on the matter was pretty clear.People can say he'll express disappointment and vote party lines anyway but that's bullshit. This is like at least the 3rd vote this year where Republicans were trying to pass something destructive that he has effectively helped shut down. Time for rational people on the left and the right to give the man his fucking due already.,
It's not a "caveat" it's the entire point.One community wishes nothing but death and suffering for someone when things don't go their way.The other has a few people doing that.Guess what? One example is representative of the whole because the whole is doing that.The other is outliers with most people wishing him well in *spite of things not going their way*.>the point is that you're acting like it's a huge deal only when the conservative subreddit does thisRemember when I said anybody doing that was bad? Especially in /r/politics? Yeah me too. Cut the bullshit.,
>      > > I'm sure you would recognize that few Republican congressmen had any input on the healthcare bill. That is not debate. They did then what Democrats are doing now.You claimed that they did the same thing. I've shown that the Democrats had their bill out in public and allowed opportunities for actual debate and amendments. The republicans have tried to force this bill through in secret. That is not what the Democrats did you are therefore lying.And while I stand by my statement that compromise is not inherently good not leaving an opening for compromise is absolutely bad.,
In case you haven't been paying attention Democrats are a minority right now so putting a law like that would be struck down in a second. Stop pretending like Democrats are the problem repealing Obamacare would leave a shitton of people without healthcare. You know what would make people on the fence want universal healthcare? Having healthcare for the first time in their lives. We need to build apon Obamacare not repeal it. Also for spouting off how affordable UH is you don't seem to understand that people can't afford to just travel to other countries for no reason. You spout off so much about how we need to understand other countries you don't seem to quite understand ours.,
Well it's pretty clear at this point that it's you that doesn't understand how the U.S. healthcare situation has evolved. Obamacare absolutely IS a step forward from what we had before. Is it where we want to end up? No. But it's better than what we had before.The Democrats are also in the minority. They can't get any changes to healthcare passed without Republican support. So stop blaming the Democrats for not understanding what needs to be done - they do but have no capability to make the needed changes. So we are left with Obamacare which while not great is a big sight better than what we had.,
>I am not following but your arguments are geared at protecting the current health system which has a lot of problems.  I'm with you so far. I agree there are a lot of problems but there's no reason to tear down the whole system when we can just fix the problems.  >Masters tools won't dismantle the master's house. If you want to go beyond preconceived notions it will require dealing with the falsehoods inherent in many current stuff that doesn't work.  Why do you have to lapse into nonsensical rhetoric? Just speak plainly and present logical arguments backed up by facts.,
It's overstated because not all of those issues are from political line drawing. I'm fairly familiar with VA politics. Yes there's some gerrymandering going on but there's also the Democrats packing themselves into some districts more as time goes on so the Blue Districts get Bluer and the Red ones Redder without the lines being redrawn at all. It's definitely an issue but it's not the only one. Democrats losing rural voters is going to have a similar effect even if you don't redraw a single line. That's also an issue. And their low performance in states with few Reps means they're at a disadvantage in those places as well (you can't gerrymander Montana but they also didn't pick good candidates to run there). It's an issue but it's not the sole issue. And some people act like it is. That's why I'm saying it's overstated. ,
There's a lot of things going on behind the scenes in the two houses of Congress that we don't usually see. A lot of the members on both sides are friends with one another and get along just fine. I've read somewhere (can't recall the source) that Obama and Boehner actually had a decent working relationship. We're they best friends? Probably not but the two of them most definitely respected one another and at least tried to negotiate on legislation (the most famous being the I'll fated grand bargain). The article then went on to explain that they both knew how the crazies in their respective parties would be up in arms if it were leaked to the press their efforts to work together so in an effort to not get the hardcore partisans upset the Whitehouse would intentionally release statements denying that Boehner and Obama were having productive meetings in the Whitehouse. I also heard Senator Al Franken say that now AG sessions is his child's godfather and sessions apparently knitted a sweater or something for his kid. Crazy isn't it?,
Percentages are meaningless without context. The difference between the numbers is 0.0486715013 which in this context is 0.0486715013%. You can try to overstate the impact by using this number as a percentage of the other but when it comes to what that number actually is meant to convey you're being very disingenuous.If you want to claim that this gives them 157258 more "people" in the House then you need determine how many States are gaining/losing "people" based on a set number of Representatives (435). The lowest number of Representatives a State can have is 1 (3 for Congress). Maybe you can time-travel to 1913 and tell Congress not to pass this law but the reality is that each State's population needs to have at least one voice in the House (absent changing the system and going by the rule set by the Founders that caused House members to increase/decrease every Census). We are not a direct democracy by design we are a Republic which mean we elect whole people to speak for us not percentages of people to speak for us.,
Bernie won the Michigan primary. Hillary lost the Michigan general. What you are saying is likely true for a lot of areas but Bernie ran a weak campaign at first. People like to blame MSM for shunning him or the DNC for working against him but not a lot of people talk about how much of a mess his campaign was at first. There was a lot of grassroots momentum they failed to capitalize on. They didn't get into those big markets soon enough to generate name recognition that would have carried across the country. All of those factors had as much if not more influence on him losing the election. It's important to recognize this and learn from it so the same mistakes aren't repeated. ,
I've been saying for months that McCain has a plan and is no supporter of Trump's. Recall that he handed the Steele dossier to the FBI personally (not knowing they already had it) and he was instrumental in the Magnitsky Act being a thing at all. Reddit's whole "hurrrr McCain won't do anything! He votes for the GOP agenda so that must mean he really likes Trump after all!" circlejerk was so tiresome and proved that people had no idea what McCain could/should actually DO to prove he is not a Trump lackey but also preserve his credibility with the rest of the GOP. ,
>I've shown that the Democrats had their bill out in public and allowed opportunities for actual debate and amendments. The republicans have tried to force this bill through in secret. That is not what the Democrats did you are therefore lying.You clearly are missing the circumstances which accompanied the passage of the ACA.>Democrats no longer had the 60th vote in the Senate to end debate. What to do? They decided to have the House take up the identical bill that the Senate passed on Christmas Eve. It passed on March 21 2010 by a 219 – 212 vote. This time no Republicans came on board and 34 Democrats voted against. President Obama signed the ACA legislation two days later on March 23. ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/physiciansfoundation/2014/03/26/a-look-back-at-how-the-president-was-able-to-sign-obamacare-into-law-four-years-ago/2/#77cc2f621020))It was rushed through so that they would not lose their filibuster majority. Just as this was rushed. Democrats blocked any attempt from Republicans to to deny the bill. Are you sincerely arguing that Republicans did not attempt the same? They quite literally rushed the bill to deny Republicans their procedural course of action.,
Refusing to redraw lines to more accurately represent changing population movements and demographics and where people are choosing to live is absolutely gerrymandering. Gerrymandering by inaction is still gerrymandering. Please read this I wrote in another thread:>People like to have their local representatives. They like have someone from their district. So here's what I like. >Double the size of the house (at least). These new representatives will be selected by the state parties but they must be selected to bring the party representation closer to the actual popular representation vote per the whole state. >So let's look at a state that has 10 representatives. Assume the popular representative vote is 50 percent republican 40 percent democrat and 10 percent libertarian. But because of the wonders of packing and cracking the districts went 7 to Republican 3 to democrat. This is not that crazy of a result. >New system: still 7 republican districts and 3 democratic districts but we get to start adding statewide reps to make it more closely align with the popular vote.>Final tally: 10 republicans 8 democrats and 2 libertarians. >You can see the fucking benefits right away. A.) the representation is in line with what the popular vote was. B.) THIRD PARTIES FINALLY START GETTING A FOOTHOLD!! If you add some kind of instant run-off or approval voting and third parties would get even stronger. >This I think would be ideal. And if this were implemented gerrymandering would just die by itself because what's the point? And Dems in wildly red districts and vice versa actually have representation and a reason to go vote. No one can say their vote doesn't matter. >Wouldn't this be beautiful?,
Yeah that's been the most frustrating part of this. The articles going around have a _lot_ of heavy editorializing which is distorting the discussion. They're framing procedural votes as votes for the actual bill which is precisely the thing McCain was arguing against in his speech the other day.It's leaving a lot of people confused and indignant over things that didn't actually happen which is intensely frustrating since McCain has actually been fairly reasonable and consistent in this (at least significantly more than the rest of his party). For the media to turn around and distort the facts this way only enforces partisan behavior and shows other Republicans that there's no reward for honesty or principle. Frankly that it won't even be recognized when it happens.,
What kind of argument is this? He wants more debate so he votes yes to allow for 20.hours.more.debate. That.is.ridiculous. If he seriously wanted more debate and bipartisanship  he should have voted no originally sent it back to committee and voted from there without time constraints. Nobody knew what bill they were working on! They had three different bills they were going to try to pass and the first two failed and thankfully this third one failed too.Everyone knew all they needed to prior to this 20-hour sprint. These proposals didn't come close to doing anything remotely beneficial to the healthcare system or for their constituents.  So no I don't think he knew anything more about the bill than I do. All you needed to know came out of their cbo scores. There was no rational reason for this dash to try to pass something. They could have just debated it openly without trying to sneak it into law. ,
That'd be true I'd this was some middle-of-the-road reasonable-idea type of legislation. But it wasn't and a good many of us who are in the "over this shit" phase have been wise to this for ages. When you pare back the double speak designed to make any of these proposals sound anything less than the certain death they will be for multitudes of Americans you're left with legislation that is simply what it is ... political pandering that will cruelly and malicious lead to the suffering and death of many. Pissed off seems like the logical response. There was never any need for more debate. There can't be debate without discourse and there has been no honest discourse from the GOP about Obamacare for the last seven years.,
I think you kinda still have it a bit wrong. The majority vote needs to total 40% of the population. If you only have 40% voter turnout you would need 100% of the votes.So lets take the ~53% turnout rate. If one side wins with 60% to 40%. you would still only have 31.8% of total populace on your side it would get rejected.  Your example is the exact reason for why it's like this. 27% vote would have gone no where. To be honest I don't know why it's 40% and not say 50% but my country have averaged ~80-85% voter turnout half of that is 40? I don't know :D  And yes not showing up to vote is stupid as fuck and accomplish nothing. Don't really know what's going on in Puerto Rico.,
>You're telling me the point of the senate is to make it so that 17.6% of the population can have control over the other 82.4%? The vast majority of Americans? If that's the case then the founding fathers were smoking crack.The Senate DOES NOT REPRESENT THE POPULATION. They represent the STATES. If your party controls half of the states you get half of the power in the senate. >Like I said it won't matter whether or not the house accurately represents the US as long as the senate exists which does not accurately represent the US. They need to agree to any law that gets proposed.The purpose of our system of government is to prevent quick change. They give power to smaller states because that is how we GOT A COUNTRY IN THE FIRST PLACE. The country would not exist if smaller states did not have an equal say in the senate. >That's false. If we had a unicameral legislature that accurately represented the country states like Vermont and Wyoming would have exactly as much representation as their populations warrant. This would not be 0. If those states make up a small portion of the national population then they should make up a small portion of the national legislature.The states would have no ability to pass anything. California NY and Texas would have definitive decisions on basically all policies and would have no reason to even reach out to such a small state. Those states have SOVEREIGNTY they have their own people to worry about and they rule over a given area. You are arguing like we are a unitary country rather than a United group of states. >So if there were a nation made up of 2 states. 1 having 1000 people living in it. The other having 1000000 living in it. And I gave them equal representation you would consider that ok? Because that is basically what is happening in our system.If that was the agreement upon which they set the system up with and they had a second house of congress distributed by population then sure that is completely acceptable. >while the senate gives every state an equal say it also skews all power towards those small states.Yes that was the POINT of the Senate. Small states would not have joined the Union. When the country was founded there were literally individual colonies (which were basically all their own individual nations culture wise). The decision was made that they would band together to form a country called the United States. Big states said "hey we have more people so we should get more representation" so the house was split evenly. Small states said "we are our own independent state we are not joining if we don't get some say at the federal level" so the Senate was made. Our government is specifically set up so that laws don't get changed unless there is ACTUALLY a consensus among the states and among the majority of people. >If we have a national legislature that has the ability to affect the entire country by passing laws bills appointing judges then that legislature should accurately represent the entire country and not just give all the power to less than a quarter of the population.No it makes sense that states would get a say in what happens to their land and people even if they don't have as many. Let's say you live in a rural state there are a bunch of rural states but most people live in the more urban ones. Now let's say that there is a law that will dramatically effect the way your farms operate. No one in the more liberal states knows anything about it and there really aren't enough representatives population wise to make sure that they do. That is what the Senate is for it allows a state like Wyoming to say "hey you don't get to make wide sweeping laws that have an effect on all other STATES with just the votes of NY CA and a slew of urban districts from other areas. We have our own state sovereignty."You are arguing against the way the system is inherently supposed to work. You are allowed to not like that we are a collection of states but you have to say that. START your argument with "I don't agree with the premise that we are all individual states and would prefer that we operate just like any other country that does not have individual states." You are advocating for something that is specifically un-American. It may work out better or worse for the majority or for the world but that isn't the country we live in. ,
You're still ignoring the fact that when they didn't get their way none of them are being decent human beings and in spite of him voting against their wishes **all of them are still wishing him death**.Right. Now. Is it one post being shitty? Is it a handful of 2 upvoted or less posts? No. It's not. It's an entire community preaching suffering *constantly*. When they didn't get their way they're fucking disgusting pieces of trash and the **whole community** acted like this./r/politics didn't. There was an OVERWHELMING amount of people cheering him on in spite of his vote. Yes there were some people who wished him ill. That's still fucked up.However those were **not the actions of the vast majority of the community**.Your equivocations are bullshit. My original point still stands.If you think it's a "ridiculous generalization" please show me how I'm wrong. I looked through the threads in TD last night and this morning and found a big fat goose egg of people saying he should get well. ,
I don't hate McCain I don't even actually hate Trump. I know if I met either of them and talked to them I would see them as my equal.What I do hate is their policies what they stand for and most importantly in this country of LAWS we live in what they VOTE for.Yes I have known loved ones with cancer why do you think I am so pissed at these republicans? These people have literally brought many of the people living in this country to the edge of death and I have no doubt they will continue to try strip healthcare from millions ever after this small victory.So with all of this said I completely understand the hate and vitriol that has been levied against these fuckers.When I was growing up I used to hear a phrase it was "Sticks and stones may brake my bones but WORDS can never hurt me"Perhaps you should contemplate that...,
Like you are saying this is a reasonable outlook on the subject but unfortunately so many on both sides are unwilling to compromise or even come to the table and discuss. It's frustrating when people on the right are unwilling to even recognize that there is a gun violence problem that maybe we should be discussing the accessibility to firearms and looking at reasonable measures. Mention any of this and there can be a knee jerk reaction "they want to take my guns!" And dialogue shuts down. Likewise on the left so many seem unwilling to understand that rural and metro areas are not the same that hunting and shooting sports are a big part of some people's culture and that "ban all the guns" isn't where the discussion should begin. It's such a frustrating topic to be a moderate on. ,
I really felt that his whole initial intention was just to get that info out there to get people talking about democratic socialism. I don't think his campaign or him really expected such a resonance with people for 10k 15k people to show up to rallies. There were all of these people wanting to volunteer and do work early to get info out there but there wasn't guidance from the campaign. That's what I mean when I say they weren't prepared to capitalize on the grassroots momentum. Eventually they got it together but by that point it was so far into the primary that they had missed their opportunity early on the get that name recognition going in states like California. It's a shame that early on they didn't run as strong of a campaign as they did later. Things may have turned out a lot different but we will really never know. ,
> I believe the last poll of Americans was way in favor of keeping the ACA.The only poll that truly has an impact is called an election.> they are owed SOMETHING for the taxes they payThat's a pretty weak argument. For one we don't choose where our taxes go or what we are owed from them. Second ACA wasn't revenue neutral given that Obama moved funds from other areas of CMS to help fund it. So ACA taxes weren't enough to actually pay for it. Third not everyone paid those taxes. A whole lot of people actually didn't.> they definitely seem to want to use the taxes they pay to keep this.Then they should vote for Democrats in 2018. In 2016 Republicans in the House who have campaigning on this issue for 8 years flat out won the popular vote. House controls allocation of money.,
It's too early on a Friday to be playing Switzerland but...Going off [the full transcript of McCain's speech](http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/25/politics/john-mccain-speech-full-text-senate/index.html) on Tuesday while the words *tax* and *cut* were indeed never said he did say > I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for the bill as it is today. It's a shell of a bill right now. We all know that. I have changes urged by my state's governor that will have to be included to earn my support for final passage of any bill. I know many of you will have to see the bill changed substantially for you to support it.> We've tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration then springing it on skeptical members trying to convince them it's better than nothing asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don't think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn't.> The Obama administration and congressional Democrats shouldn't have forced through Congress without any opposition support a social and economic change as massive as Obamacare. And we shouldn't do the same with ours.Take that as you will.,
Then it sounds like you have nothing to fear at all.  They will find nothing when more and more states enact voter ID laws.  There is nothing to worry about at all.Sorry to debunk your 'debunking' article.  But your analysis focuses on convictions. That completely eludes the point I made earlier...how do you charge somebody with a felony when you aren't even sure if they should have voted to begin with?See the disenchantment of a vote happens two ways.  One is by not allowing people to vote and the other is by allowing too many people to vote.Let's give an example:  Your county wants to vote on a measure to mandate that people who live there have to pay an additional tax of 20% of your income per year.  But...when it comes time to vote they let people who don't live in your area to come and vote for it.  Now.  How will you go about proving that some of those people shouldn't have voted?,
> whether or not you like it it is still possible for a minority to gain control in a system like this which doesn't sit well with me at all. That's not a representative system and in my opinions n a legislature should be representative. It does not make minority control possible because the senate is about the states. If you don't understand that then you just don't get it.>Also what's with the caps lock? It doesn't help your argument. It just makes you look like you're yelling at me for disagreeing.I am using it for emphasis not yelling sorry.> don't know where this notion comes from where he country would be changing everything fast if we just had a House of Representatives. It would still be slow because 1 the country and markets don't like big sweeping changes and 2 if you made it so that you needed supermajorities to pass certain legislation in the house like they do in the senate that would also curb the amount of sweeping changes that happen.The idea comes from the countless times in history there has been a single party take a chamber very swiftly and dramatically shift the political spectrum (see Nazi Germany). >And yeah I realize that we wouldn't have a United States without the senate but I honestly don't think it was worth it. We have a unified country sure but at the cost of having a legislature that actually represents the people. We would also have a much more representative and democratic system if the states had stayed independent.yes we would have a more representative system if we had multiple smaller countries but we also wouldn't be the lone world superpower.>And to counter the argument that we would be over taken by Britain if that happened I'm ok with that. Call me an unpatriotic commie all you want but if the states wouldn't be able to put aside their differences and unify to fight Britain for their independence due to greed then I'm ok with Britain taking it over again.ok well that is just kind of arguing in bad faith if you don't care about the well-being of the country as an entity in and of itself.>People say the same exact thing about the electoral college but plenty of other countries elect their leaders by popular vote and plenty of other countries have representative legislatures.Plenty of other countries ARE NOT a union of states but rather a single state.> It's common sense. Farmers living in a sparsely populated state don't deserve to have more influence than their populations warrant.Not unless they are an independent state. States in the EU get more weight than their population all the time.>So why should there be a senate and national government if every state is sovereign?Because the states agreed that it would be good to give up a limited amount of sovereignty to the federal government PROVIDED they all get a say in it. They agreed that would be better for all parties. You are also completely rehashing the argument of federalism.> Then they should've remained independent and the founders shouldn't have created a crappy legislative system just to pander towards smaller states and acquire more land. I have no problem with large states forming unions with other large state while the small ones remain independent.The states are stronger together than they are individually. That is a fact you can choose to not like it but that is the way it is. There would be NO United States if the states had not fought together for a single government. >I have no problem with large states forming unions with other large state while the small ones remain independent.Well you weren't the one who made the country were you?>Then I would try and convince the leaders of my state to secede and form their own unions with other small states rather than create a system that gives me an unfair advantage. I honestly think that state should be allowed to secede if they don't like the way something is going.1. The ability to secede from a union dramatically weakens the strength of that union itself. 2. The south seceding had multiple things wrong with it. First it was a human rights issue them seceding didn't free their slaves. Secondly it was a threat to the sovereignty of those who remained in the Union as the south would have been an enemy even if the war had not happened. Thirdly it would undermine the union's purpose as a whole if states could just secede whenever they didn't get their way. >You could use the "un-American" label for literally any idea that goes against the status quo. It's meaningless.I would agree with you in most all cases. The "un-American" line of attack is very commonly used in a misguided manner to tar anyone questioning the way the system works. The difference is you are not questioning the way the system works you are fundamentally disagreeing with the underlying premises the system is built upon. You are suggesting that we are not a collection of states but rather just a single state. >Honestly we are just talking in circles at this point. I am constantly repeating myself and so are you. Usually when arguments stalemate like this it just means that we have fundamental different ways of thinkingYou aren't wrong here. We definitely have fundamentally different viewpoints.,
Do you even know what an opinion is? Deal with the question: the world considers Angela Merkel as the leader of the free world. That's how the leader of the free world is decided: it's by a survey of who actually looks to someone as a leader. The majority of the world including the United States considers that leader to be Merkel.If you want my opinion it's this: I don't give two shits about the United States as a country or a national entity. I'm not a Democrat or a liberal. My interest in anything having to do with Trump or his success or failures goes as far as how much I consider all of this to be political theater. Trump's attempt to turn the executive office into a reality TV show the Democrats' trying to solely blame their failures as a party on a relatively weak nation that relatively weak nation trolling the entire country into voting for an admitted sexual harasser and dullard who lucked his way into wealth and fame. This is where history has gone from tragedy to farce.However what is worrying to me is how clearly much of a cult Trump's fans are. I don't care about liberals or conservatives "the left" and the "alt-right" fighting for control of the country. But when you take this and start denying the stone cold facts of the situation you've moved from being a political movement to being a religious cult. And it's not just y'all. Hillary supporters and Bernie supporters do the same thing. But y'all are in power right now. I mean can you not see how plainly ridiculous it is to complain about an "obstructionist Democratic party" holding things up when it's your party that holds control of both houses? Is it a Democrat right now that's holding up nominations in the Interior subcommittee? No. It's a Republican who was threatened by another Republican to a spectacularly bad gamble. Think about that for two seconds. You're trying to blame the failures of your president on a section of the political landscape that has no power. We can start from there and go on but that's fundamental. At the very least.,
Which is why that's typically when redistricting is done it has to be in many cases. But 20 states have independent commissions or only one Rep so those likely are off the table (a commission redistricting extra times probably doesn't go over well). In the rest they could if the state constitution or law doesn't restrict it but it'd probably be challenged if any seats were going to flip and it's hard to address that issue anyway. If you divide the city up you risk it not having any representation if people of one party keep moving in or out of the city well that's self selected gerrymandering. ,
