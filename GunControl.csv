The article gets it wrong; the ability to buy AR15s  and similar weapons is not what's wrong with America's gun law. Other nations like Switzerland have that ability without the level of violence and number of school shootings the states has. The bare fact of gun ownership is not the problem and indeed it's good that citizens can arm themselves. The cause of the level of violence in the US is it's inequality levels rather than gun ownership levels (which actually has a slight negative correlation on homicide rates). Fixing inequality and improving mental health care along with controls to block people known to be criminally aggressive from acquiring guns is the route to take not banning the weapons themselves from people generally who so have the right to bear arms,R
"I won't support anything that alters the Second Amendment.I was on board with some reasonable changes but lately on r/politics there's been this drumming up of ""repeal the 2nd!"" sentiment that's really making me want to dig my heels in. I think going down that road is going to lose a lot of goodwill. I'm not going to run out and vote for some Republican but I'm definitely not voting for any Democrat that supports repealing the 2nd. Even the suggestion of a repeal poisons the debate.You might feel like no compromise was possible anyway but throwing that up on the table is a sure fire way to cement that impossibility into reality.",R
The authors pro 2A bona fides is suspect.  For one he should know that the gun show loophole is a myth.  If you legally buy a gun from a licensed dealer at a gun show you go through the same background checks etc that you do anyplace else.For another he seems to imply that an AK is a machine gun.  The ones legally available here are semi-automatic.  While it is theoretically possible to buy a machine gun in the United States you can‰Ûªt buy anything manufactured after 1986 and plan on spending $10000+.  Also unless you own a museum or train military or law enforcement plan on having your application to own one denied.,R
Country of 320 million+ Thats 320000000 for people who need a visualization. 320 people killed in a year by rifles. that's 0.000001% of the population....gets called an epidemic. Time to ban them...1000 people killed by police in a year vast majority have previous violent crimes or are wanted for violent crimes. ..Police pull over more than 50000 drivers on a typical day more than 20 million motorists every year. Called an epidemic.....Majority of gun deaths in USA are suicide followed by gang related homicides..hand guns are primarily used. Time to ban semi-automatic rifles.Yea you don't need to be a conservative to see a problem with this.,R
"Ok what is reasonable gun control?People keep on bringing up the parkland shooter he would have never had access to the gun if local law enforcement and FBI didn't fail that community. The fact that he was deemed ""not a threat to himself or others"" after self harming is asinine. Whoever cleared him should lose their license to practice. Everyone keeps going on and on about banning ""high capacity mags"" ""assault weapons"" etc. When some of the deadliest shooting of all time were done with <10 rounds mags and guns that were legal during an assault weapon ban. Further more in almost every single case of these shootings the perpetrator had tons of warning signs that went ignored often months before the shooting happened. ",R
"I agree with some of what it says in the article.  Here are some of the sticky points for me an a lot of gun owners.1)  Universal background checks are fine under the following conditions: it has to be available 24/7/365; no FFL is required; it is free; no make model or serial numbers for the guns.  I can't be charged to exercise other rights and if it is just a background check then no need for the gun info.2) 21 age limit is a problem for me.  If you are an adult at 18 you should have all the rights responsibility and privileges of an adult.  (Note: feel the same way as alcohol sales etc)3) Rather see bump stocks NFA regulated rather than all out banned.  They aren't all that hard to make and registration is better than creating a black market.4) Magazine capacity bans.  Why?  Will it really achieve much?  There have been shooters that use 10 round mags.  And what is magical about 10 rounds?  Why not 15 or 20 or 25?  5) Arming teachers is a dumb idea.  But so are gun free zones.And let me add this point.  Nothing and I mean *nothing* proposed by either side of this has anything to do with prevention.  Everything proposed is about ""acceptable"" body counts.  Where is the call for mental healthcare?  Or how about anti-poverty programs?  Or ending the war on drugs?  So many other things can be done to *prevent* violence instead of just keeping the death toll ""acceptable"".",R
"I think that we need to stop with all of the control. On guns weed anything that's chipping away at our freedoms to live life. And start to focus on things that really would make a difference. Like striving to help broken families building inclusive communities and promoting acceptance. Less regulation and more responsibility. It's not the government's job to put a bandaid over something that the way our society has progressed is responsible for. The more regulation gets put out there to ""fix"" things for people the more resentment is going to be bred and the worse things will become. We need to stand up and be responsible for one another. Stand up against that bully. Speak out when professors are being unfair. Stand up and protest against corruption in government. Be a friend. Be a neighbor. No one else can do that for you. And things will not get better until we do what's right. ",R
Once again an anti gun article ripe with inaccuracy and made up stories. The AK 47 sold in the US is not a military weapon it is a semi automatic rifle that looks like the military rifle. The person to person transfer is not only rare but has never been involved in one of the mass shootings and AR type weapons are the least used in crime overall. It is also completely illogical to sell a weapon to another person without paperwork. If you sell it you are putting your name on any crimes the individual who buys it commits. If you buy one without paperwork and are caught with it you have no proof of ownership and could yourself be buying a gun tied to a crime. The bump stock ban is perfectly reasonable because it does turn a semi automatic rifle into an almost automatic one though wildly inacurate. He also made the exact point of every 2A supporter with his inmate visited grandma story including the fact that by the time police get there in any situation it is far too late. His grandmother would also been way better off with an AR15 than a shotgun because the shotgun would likely knock her over and the AR15 would easily be handled by her. The elderly are prime examples of people who need weapons for protection because they have almost no other ability to protect themselves. So just keep right on lying and making our points for us anti 2A nuts.,R
I‰Ûªm a liberal pro-choice pro universal healthcare pro universal minimum income atheist gun owner.  I love my AR-15s because they are easy to maintain easy to use easy to learn reliable customizable firearms.  I believe in common sense gun control; but the main issue is the definition of ‰ÛÏcommon sense‰Û is very much the opposite in many cases.  Currently many of the definitions of ‰ÛÏassault weapons‰Û have been written by people with little to no experience with firearms; example would be a pistol grip is a feature that makes a rifle an assault weapon ([source Wikipedia article that has references](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon) ).  But the mini-14 and M1A (civilian M-14) are both high quality firearms that do the same things the AR15 does just as well but with no pistol grip. . . There are many examples of this and some of the ‰ÛÏassault weapons‰Û features are also safety features (barrel shroud keeps you from burning yourself flash suppressor helps you keep it under control better).I know one of the main sticking points is the magazine capacity; there is no way to tell exactly how many standard capacity 30 round magazines are out there; probably in the hundreds of millions since everyone with an AR15 AK pattern and other similar style rifle probably has at least 3-4 and some as many as 20-30; this will make enforcement of any registration or ban impossible and cost hundreds of millions of dollars (which could be better used putting toward health care homelessness alternative energy breaks almost anything).  Setting a magazine limit of 10 would have a negligible effect as well because of the quick reload time of many of these firearms (.5-3 seconds depending on gun and users skill level) they would reload before anyone gets a chance to move.  Even in states with limits already in place the effects are still not clear [CNN article about magazine limits](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/10/05/politics/gun-laws-magazines-las-vegas/index.html) .Some of the compromises that I would definitely be in favor for would be capacity limits of 30; this is the standard capacity magazine and there is absolutely no reason to have more then this unless you are a shitty shot or at a range blowing money. . . The military doesn‰Ûªt even use magazine larger then 30.  Bumpfire stocks are also nothing but range toys or much much worse. . . They completely kill your guns accuracy and make it useless for anything but again blowing ammo/money at the range or mowing down people without caring who you hurt.Raising the Age to own guns to 21 might not fly for most people but it makes sense since many of these school shootings are committed by current or in parklands case; recent students who are still teenagers.  If you make it harder for them to go out and buy a gun you will prevent some tragedies.  A compromise that might fly with the hunting crowd would be banning semi-automatic ownership till 21; that way 18yo hunters can still obtain bolt lever and pump action guns.  There also needs to be better mental health treatment and followup by law enforcement.  In the case of Parkland the shooter was reported numerous times but the FBI failed to followup and never bothered to even ask local law enforcement to followup.  With mental health there needs to be more proactive approach to this that would help people who have been reported find help before they do something terrible and also require it to be state funded and/or covered by insurance.  The ‰ÛÏred flag‰Û law that recently took effect is good in that it lets a judge temporarily remove guns from someone who is deemed a danger to themselves or other because of their mental state.  my only issue would be how this is enforced since it could be a slippery slope in what determines if someone is a danger to themselves or others and also how do they get their guns back after they are cleared?  Many people have an extremely hard time getting their guns back after using them in a justified case of self defense.So TL;DR. Common sense gun control is needed but that doesn‰Ûªt include banning a category or weapon but does include age magazine capacity over 30 and bumpfire stock bans as well as better mental health and law enforcement followup.Edit: spelling,R
"So the Parkland shooter who bought his gun with a background check demonstrated that we need more background checks. Flawless logic there. The NICS system is only as good as the info that goes into it. I've been saying for years we need to improve communication between agencies. I would also like to see the voluntary background checks that were proposed after Sandy Hook put into place and to give those some time to see what actual impact they have on crime. And here come the ""voluntary won't work"" people who I'm sure in other threads have said ""we have to do something!""",R
"I just think a lot of people have a super knee jerk reaction to these things even if they don't partake in gun ownership or sport/collection.VT just passed a law making it so the age has been upped to 21 and that you can't have large capacity magazines. A friend of mine (who leans right just not full-bore right)  who *does not own a gun does not go shooting does not collect* said literally this (last night) after learning about the new restrictions:""oh yeah? really? ok i'll illegally buy a massive drum and get any gun I fucking want and they aren't going to come to my house and take it away""soooo I thought I would conveniently mention ""I've never once see you even *holding* a gun let alone owning one. So what is your need to own one *now* as opposed to anytime before the restrictions got passed?""so he says ""who cares? I can decide to own a gun anytime I want and considering the new law being put into place I want to show them that that the concept of this just doesn't work"".so he only wants to go *against* said new laws and restrictions purchasing said items potentially illegally *for the sole purpose of proving the restrictions do not work*. ",R
"I'm a democrat that has supported the 2nd amendment all my life but I'm sitting this one out. For the last year and a half the GOP has turned politics into a steamroller and just barreled over us without negotiation or consideration or decency at all really. Because they know that if they just don't ever let up the other side will eventually cave and they'll get what they want.  This is not politics this is pre-politics from a time when the guy with the biggest rock made the rules. Now the kids have learned that technique. They're going to use emotion and optics to ram this down your throats and they're not going to give you an inch of negotiation because they know if they do you'll just use it to say *""now is not the time for discussion.""* We've come to see that the only way to deal with the GOP is to just bulldog them down the field because if you don't they're already doing it to you.So this is the bed you made there's nothing I can do now. Its been 20 years since Columbine... that was the time to have discussion and build good will. Now they're steamrolling. And we're probably going to lose some gun rights and that'll be unfortunate. But I cant think of more poetic justice that the right losing gun rights during the Trump presidency. Actions have consequences. ",R
"I for one don't believe our founding fathers meant for the first amendment to have the impact it has today. When they thought of the concept freedom of speech they only meant it to protect your ability to talk to people face to face. That's all there was back then! They didn't foresee the advent of telegrams telephones email or the internet! If they knew that one person could command a global audience from the privacy of their own home there is no way they would have put this in the bill of rights. We're talking about the people that invented the representative system and the electoral college they of all people knew that not every voice needs to be heard. You see how silly this argument sounds with regards to the second amendment?Do you know how silly you sound when you advocate for laws that currently exist? What are ""common sense"" gun laws? That's just a political faÌ¤ade to get everyone on the band wagon. Everyone assumes our political leaders are steering the wagon in the direction they'd personally steer it and don't pay much attention to the destination. By the time the news picks up on the crazy bullshit they're voting on its too late too polarized and everyone on the bandwagon doesn't want to *kill the children* so they blindly support the fucknuttery that's put in front of them.Its easy to point the finger but maybe we need to take a look in the mirror as a society and do some self reflection. The further back in time you go the less gun restrictions there were and the less school shootings there were. The only thing that hasn't changed is the guns they've always been there. What has changed is our society education system definition of a family child raising etc. Its like that meme that was going around kids will walk out of class (imagine that) to support gun reform but they won't stand up for that weird kid in the corner. How long has that anti-bullying campaign been going? **Why are we allowing children to guide a discussion about the Bill of Rights?**Clearly these children know better than those asshats that organized a revolution won and created a new idea of government that most of the world soon adopted! No this is the corkscrewed American media polarizing the bandwagon. There will be another civil war before the second amendment is repealed I am certain. Please stop advocating for laws the infringe upon the second amendment. Its unconstitutional illegal and not the right thing to do. Any route along this path will only be a faÌ¤ade covering the real damage and too many of these routes lead down very dangerous paths. ",L
"> **How then do we restore a measure of sanity to the regulation of firearms without sacrificing our Second Amendment freedoms?** Before implementing gun control that is likely to work with an estimated 310 million guns floating around the country there needs to be comprehensive universal background checks and no more loopholes for gun-show sales and person-to-person transfers of firearms.This is the proper format for a gun control debate and the creation of new gun control laws.Coming out as a ""complete repeal type"" of the 2nd Amendment is not how you handle it. > **Even Trump‰Ûªs strongest supporters would stick with him on certain gun control measures.** I observed an evolution in viewpoint similar to my own this month during Ashcroft in America focus groups in Memphis Tennessee and Oxford and Jackson Mississippi. **The majority of our participants were gun owners who strongly believe in the right to bear arms but are open to banning bump stocks and high-volume magazines stricter background checks and increasing the age limit to 21 for buying an AR-15 and other semi-automatic rifles. They also reject arming teachers as a solution to the school shootings that have become commonplace in the country and their own communities.**Slow and steady is the only way to handle it. You have to look reasonable you have to be the adult in the room. The republicans are going to scream and whine and lie as is. Going completely off the grid of reality is just playing into the hands of the republicans and gives them the ammo in which to rally their supporters.",L
"You can support the Second Amendment and still support gun control.I absolutely support the First Amendment but also fully support laws against slander libel yelling-fire-in-a-theater and other ""common sense speech restrictions"".In the _exact_ same vein few Second Amendment supporters believe ""the right to keep and bear arms"" includes the right to keep bazookas and other heavy weapons despite those weapons clearly being ""armaments"".The debate should not be ""if"" there should be limits but what limits there should be.By refusing to even debate the point Second Amendment absolutists only are ensuring that _when_ the restrictions come they won't be at the table to negotiate.",L
"This article was written by Elise Jordan. She works for MSNBC (shocking)https://twitter.com/Elise_Jordan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5EauthorLet's unpack this article and translate it for those who want to understand multiple viewpoints because to a pro-2nd amendment American this lady is full of shit. She's not trying to be reasonable. She's advocating bans. She's advocating the destruction of the Bill of Rights 2a by a method other than getting 38 states to repeal it. That's should highly concern you even if you don't agree with the constitution. After all how would anyone react if someone claimed to be asking for ""common sense"" restrictions on your freedom of speech but was really advocating banning the freedom of speech. Let's look for the propaganda and manipulations that is rather blatant to some but totally unrecognizable to others.> A decade ago while I was in Afghanistan working at the NATO/ISAF headquarters I bragged to my late father about shooting an AK-47 and he decided he wanted to buy one himself. One evening at around midnight the phone rang and my mother groggily answered. The man on the line apologized for the late hour but told her he was on parole and it was the only time he could call without getting caught by his mother. He had seen my father‰Ûªs want ad for an AK-47 and had one to unload. My mother told him to never call our home again.This is a fucking lie almost guaranteed. It's a multifaceted package of propaganda designed to paint a picture in your mind. She includes a man on parole to plant it in your mind that it's a dark and shadowy underground business to be buying these rifles and if you're a wife or mother you're justified in stopping this behavior. There's more: AK-47's have been banned for sale in the United States since 1986. The ones that sold before 1986 are still available but they are rare as fuck and if you do find one you must fill out an ATF form. Have your local law enforcement sign off on it. Get permission from the government which takes about a year. Then pay anywhere from $15000 to $40000 for the grandfathered rifle. Now let's assume the writer of the article was telling the truth and her family member was actually after an AK-47 *style* of rifle which means its not real. It only looks like an AK-47. It doesn't actually fire like a machine gun or in other words it doesn't fire fully automatic like a real one. Only one bullet comes out when you squeeze the trigger. In that case her family member could of just ran to to a gun shop and bought one for less than a $1000. No midnight arms deals with ex-cons responding to a newspaper add needed. (Its laughable to the informed) ""Newspaper Ad WANTED: AK-47 In Good Condition"" *Ring! Ring! ""Hello?"" ""Yes Hi Ma'am this is Spike I'm on parole from prison and I'm whispering because my mom's asleep and I was wanting to sell you my AK-47""> More recently another relative purchased an AR-15 in a legal person-to-person transaction with no oversight or paper trail whatsoever. The seller even threw in several rounds of ammunition and an extra 30-round magazine for good measure. It‰Ûªs shocking that Americans in many states can obtain a weapon designed for soldiers in combat situations..... there needs to be comprehensive universal background checks and no more loopholes for gun-show sales and person-to-person transfers of firearms. More propaganda with ""no more loopholes for gun-show sales"".... If she had any credibility left over from her fake AK-47 story she just lost the rest of it on her gun-show loop holes bullshit. The gun show loop hole propaganda used to be passed around a lot more but as more and more people became educated on the subject people stopped believing it. The truth is there is no gun show loop hole. Vendors at a gun show have to run an FBI background check on you just like any other firearm dealer. She's either knowingly pushing propaganda on you OR she's unqualified to be working for Time/MSNBC as a political analyst/contributor on this subject. When your constitutional rights are on the line its important to know if the person writing for Time/MSNBC is pushing propaganda or ignorance.The propaganda continues: She writes- > and person-to-person transfers of firearms. A recent study published in Annals of Internal Medicine estimated that one out of five gun owners purchasing a weapon during a two-year window starting in April 2015 did so without undergoing a background check.She's correct here in that you can get around the FBI background check if you purchase a firearm from another citizen or if you get one from your dad or brother etc etc. It's still illegal for either one of you to participate in the transfer of a firearm to someone who can't have one. Also take note that she pulled data from a known anti-gun faction who and this is where she almost got you cherry picked a time period of hectic gun sales-- An election year 2015 when Hillary Clinton was running on a platform of gun bans.... Whenever an anti-gun candidate runs there's a huge run on gun sales.  I myself believe we should require background checks in these transfers even though they only make up 10-20% of transfers and of those they are rarely illegal. I don't think the idea of banning rifle sales to adults age 18-21 will survive a Supreme Court challenge under the equal protections clause being that we're talking your constitutional rights not drinking a beer.  Her push to ban 30 round magazines is ridiculous. As if carrying three 10 round magazines is anything other than annoying. To people who have rifles it does nothing but automatically label herself and her argument as either propaganda or ignorance just like her gun show loophole argument. Some facts that she left out:Gun violence has plummeted since the 90's.https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/05/14/disarming-realities-as-gun-sales-soar-gun-crimes-plummet/#170fab963f7chttp://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/07/gun-homicide-rate-down-49-since-1993-peak-public-unaware/People use firearms to defend themselves from raperobbery and murder way more than they are used for homicide. Waaay more. It's not even close. It's not even in the same ballpark. ""Estimates over the number of defensive gun uses vary wildly depending on the study's definition of a defensive gun use survey design population criteria time-period studied and other factors. Low-end estimates are in the range of 55000 to 80000 incidents per year while high end estimates reach of 4.7 million per year""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_useNow why did she appear to condemn rifles with her bullshit AK-47 and AR-15 stories while appearing to accept them at the end? It's another type of propaganda used where they purposely say they only want reasonable background checks but are actually pushing for attacks on the very rifles that make the 2nd amendment viable.   Even pro-2nd liberals like myself are fully aware that there's a faction in our party that's trying to ban guns and over the last month its been an *unmitigated disaster* as we went from the party of healthcare to the party of bans. The anti-2nd faction seems like they're doing everything they can to ruin the blue wave. How in the fuck are we going to win Texas with pro-ban Beto running? Let that sink in.....pro-ban......in Texas.....While we mock conservatives about them being concerned about bans look at what the anti-2nd faction has in congress as we speak-https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5087/textRead the list of rifles. That bans the sale of the overwhelming majority of the rifles in the United States. Now look at how many sponsors it has. Then look up how many seats the anti-gun faction of the DNC is projected to win in November.The destruction of the Bill of Rights 2a by bans is unacceptable. The loss of blue wave elections because of an authoritarian faction of our party is ridiculous. We always mock conservatives with ""No One Wants to Take Your Guns!"" yet there's a faction of our party that's making us look like authoritarians. This could cost us elections like the last time the anti-gun faction did this.https://www.reddit.com/r/NOWTTYG/https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/",R
The 2nd Amendment guarantees weapons for the purpose of the maintenance of a state militia. It doesn't specify what weapons should be available.That's why civilians aren't nomally allowed things like rocket launchers or flamethrowers. (Edit: I find this surprising but apparently there may be fewer restrictions on these things that I thought). There is already precedent to interpret the amendment according to the sensibilities of our time.Therefore I don't see any reasonable reason why the Far-Right demands a national discussion into reasonable gun control must be silenced.Do people really need something like an assault weapon to defend their home? To defend their home from what? A swarm of zombies?,L
"I'm not sure this ""I support the 2nd Amendment but..."" argument is getting through to the NRA and its staunchest supporters. /s  As a naturalized citizen from a country that banned guns who took an oath to defend The Constitution *I* support the 2nd Amendment. I don't know anyone in my liberal town who *doesn't* support the 2nd Amendment.  We can *support the 2nd Amendment* as hard as we like till the cows come home and it doesn't matter to the hard-line gun people because they don't hear ""we support the 2nd Amendment but we want better gun regulation"" - everything before the ""but"" is BS. They just hear ""we want better gun regulation"" - and we and they both know that realistic meaningful change that prevents mass shootings suicides gun robberies and gang killings means one or both of two things:  1) Something like a 50-year plan of progressive improvements leading to more equality opportunity and life outcomes in every area of American life - healthcare mental health education policing the criminal justice system infrastructure nutrition community health  job training pollution control income support transportation. Is everyone on board with that? Great - maybe then we could become a nation where people just don't feel like killing themselves or each other quite so much; and/or2) Restricting access to and the carrying of those weapons most involved in day-to-day gun crime *and* mass shootings: high-velocity high-caliber easily-concealed fast-reload high-capacity rapid-fire bump-stock...did I miss anything. And then what's left for gun owners? Small-caliber sports rifles and target pistols for sport shooting single-shot long-arms for hunting double-cartridge shotguns for small game and pest control - farmers hunters and sportspeople.  So as a staunch supporter of realistic gun regulation and the Constitution I see that only one side is really being honest and it's not the gun-control side.

as well-funded bureaucracies ( https://www.thetrace.org/2018/03/gun-background-check-staff-shortage-justice-department-budget/ )This does not exist right now. The Justice Department office is underfunded and understaffed and background checks that can't be completed or maybe even started will pass if it takes more than the 3-day waiting period.

The left should out flank the right and offer fully automatic assault rifles in exchange for a licensing and registration process similar to vehicles. A motorcycle cycle license is a couple weekend training and test. A CDL comes with another barrier of entry. The DMV will be near obsolete over the next 30 years with the rise of autonomous vehicles and Uber pods that deliver people to destinations.  All that infrastructure can transition directly to a firearm licensing structure. Then layer a data operation over the top to track firearm and ammo purchases tied back to your firearm license number.  A sudden increase above the mean triggers a deeper look into the license holders current circumstance.  Bobs wife left him his dog died and he was fired from his job. Uh let‰Ûªs send someone over to take a closer look.  Or him and his buddies are gearing up for a 3 day weekend of blasting beers and shooting guns well have fun and be careful. ,L
"Just like Immigration reform we don't need more gun control. Almost all guns sold in this country require a background check except for the super rare person to person sell which not one ""mass"" shooting has ever been attributed  to one of these type of sales. What we hear time and time again is that the gun used in these tragic events was legally purchased. What would be great is if local police the FBI school admins friends and family of a possible shooter said or did or acted to stop the shooting before it ever happens. For crying out loud the Parkland shooter was known and never made his plans hidden and a whole host of people missed it! And other shooters have been ""interviewed"" or ""questioned"" but for whatever reason nothing was ever done. Change that and I guarantee you shootings won't happen as much. But the fact is there isn't one proposed gun control measure that would stop a shooting from occurring. ",R
"I want a tiered licencing system for gun ownership that also brings back NFA restricted items. I own so-called assault weapons but I want stricter controls on how people can buy not just them but all guns. What they should do is create a compromise system. Abrogate all State-Level Assault Weapons bans and Concealed Carry laws and institute a National system structured something like this:**Class A** Firearms are Bolt Action Rifles Pump-Action Single-Shot and Break Open Shotguns and Semi-Automatic rifles with a 5 round internal magazines. Class A would be available at 18 without a license after a background check exactly like we have now.**Class B** firearms would include handguns all other semi-automatic rifles (including SBRs) semi-automatic magazine-fed shotguns and short-barreled shotguns. Create a ""shall-issue"" license system that is gained after a brief police interview reference check consent to mental health records search and a brief 1-2 hour safety class with multiple choice test following (think how we currently do Hunter's Safety courses). Applicant must be 21 years of age. Full right of appeal to a judge for denial of license and clear guidelines on what people can be denied for and what they can't. If you're denied and you appeal the police have to explain to the court why and present testimony or other evidence to show that they have a reasonable concern about you having firearms. Burden of Proof is on the police to show you shouldn't be approved rather than on the applicant to show that they should. An exception would be if the applicant has a documented history of mental illness or substance abuse which places the burden on them to prove that they are fit for approval. A Concealed carry license would be a sub category of Class B (Call it License B(2)) it carries the additional caveats of a practical demonstration of weapons proficiency and an additional class on identifying and dealing with a threat.**Class C** firearms would be select-fire assault rifles belt-fed machine guns etc. Maybe suppressors as much as I would like them to be more readily available. Must be in good standing and have had a Class B license without incident for two years. This is where you would have a more comprehensive mental health screening and an inspection of your home to ensure the weapons can be properly secured. Interview and background check of all members of your household.All gunowners will be legally obligated to maintain their own records of all their weapons regardless of classification so that if a weapon is stolen or lost they can easily provide investigators with make model and serial number. Failure to report a lost or stolen weapon carries strict penalties as does not being able to produce records for police upon request. Police would only be able to request with a warrant or if you are reporting it lost or stolen yourself.

"The American government is so broken it is literally killing people as well-funded bureaucracies fail to keep guns out of the hands of men and women who are not fit for the awesome responsibility.Ok bureaucracies are already ""well funded"" yet they still are incapable of enforcing existing law responding to numerous warnings that the Parkland shooter was as very real threat.  So a few more laws and restrictions on our rights will work how? The Sheriff's made contact with the shooter nearly 40 times and never got a decent arrest they flat out didn't do their jobs and simply passed the buck on to someone else.  No one has 40 incidents with the Police and doesn't get arrested at least a couple time out of those contacts.Lets stop living in fantasy land where the government has our best interest at heart they don't and they see us as mere tax paying subjects.  Some in government (far left and weak RINOS) would love to see guns simply vanish from America.  An armed populace creates a citizenry while a disarmed populace creates mere subjects.  I happen to value my freedom and you should to!  This belief Government is always good and would never harm is false.  I can point to all the hundreds of millions killed when the government takes peoples guns but for some reason everyone on Reddit believes we have ""grown past that sort of thinking"" or ""that was other countries our government would never do that to us"".  All I have to say is look into what the CIA has down to our own people tell me with a straight face our government loves us.  So I'll point to China look what President Jinping has just done over there he is now a dictator.  You'd think after the Chairman Mao deaths they would have learned their lesson but they haven't.  Lets say the Chinese finally wake up this being Mao 2.0 what can they do?  Not a damn thing since the people are disarmed!  How wonderful another dictator and the people are powerless to stop it.  This is the scenario some Americans want you guys will actually beg and plead for the state to be the only ones with arms.  Very sad that my fellow American's just eat up whatever the TV tells them to and go along with ridding ourselves of our rights.  I just don't understand why you people are still here.  Move to Europe or China where no on has those evil guns politically is right up your alley since China and most of Europe are centrally planned utopias.  Also this guy is no Libertarian as a Libertarian myself we fully realize rights are natural and given at birth.  The government through the 2nd amendment is merely recognizing our right to self defense.  Government doesn't grant rights any Libertarian worth his salt is aware of that.  Demanding the state strip our rights for our own safety goes against everything a Libertarian believes in this guy is merely a RINO type that believes government is the answer.   ",R
>It‰Ûªs shocking that Americans in many states can obtain a weapon designed for soldiers in combat situationsIt shouldn't be. Instead it should be shocking that Americans could obtain another bajillion of them and still be utterly powerless against the national military.This guy was born into an empire joined its military came back home and internalized the exact opposite mentality of what the founders wanted for citizens of a constitutional republic.But hey whatever. The empire will keep stockpiling and using shitloads of guns to prop up our Green Zone privileges and that's wonderful even though guns and violence are terrible. As long as my backyard is a tiny bit safer - well you know from other plebs - it's all good.,L
People need to realize something: you can be pro-Second Amendment AND pro-Gun Control. They're not mutually exclusive.I personally think the Second Amendment is absurd but I'm also not from America and I'm smart enough to see that it's too entrenched in America's culture to ever be repealed. And even if it weren't the majority of Americans on every part of the political spectrum don't WANT it to be repealed. The Second Amendment isn't going anywhere any time soon but by limiting the more destructive weapons increasing background checks closing loopholes and requiring training and a license like cars do steps can be taken to reduce the amount of deaths caused by firearms.The Second Amendment protects your right to own a firearm. It doesn't tell you which firearms you have a right to own.,L
I think the logic is that killing people is already illegal. Almost all murders by guns are done by hand guns which the ‰ÛÏassault weapons ban‰Û wouldn‰Ûªt stop. You‰Ûªre just infringing on the second amendment meaninglessly. Although I do think we need stricter background checks. I think we also need mental health checks.  Also I agree that cannabis should be legalized as it‰Ûªs not as dangerous as other drugs that are legal. It can also serve for medicinal purposes. I do not think it‰Ûªs productive to straw man republican ideals because it just perpetuates the ‰ÛÏus vs them‰Û mentality and further polarizes our country. This is coming from someone who‰Ûªs fairly conservative btw. ,L
"I am weary of people using drugs to compare with guns. The illegal gun trade if guns were illegal is not even remotely the same as people buying and selling drugs. (not talking about cartels).Most people actually don't consider drugs to be a criminal act. It's definitely not good but these addicts and users aren't criminals. We're slowly working our way to that from a legislative sense. And some aren't even problematic to begin with. As a teen I was almost in legal trouble for marijuana. Today it's completely legal in my state. Nothing changed about our attitudes. There was no ""harm"" in marijuana. Now we have laws to reflect this.On the other hand today if a group of people in the UK were trafficking guns and people were buying traffic guns illegally we would consider them pretty serious criminals right? The same would be true in the future of the US. Moving illegal guns is big time crime. Personal drug use is not. Most people do not WANT to be big time criminals. The last part of that is that drugs are illegal in the UK. Guns are also illegal in the UK. Drugs are everywhere. Guns are not. People can't tell me these barriers don't work. Manufacturing firearms and ammunition and moving fire arms and ammunition is a world apart from the drug trade. ",L
I‰Ûªm a conservative and I also agree that cannabis should be legalized. I live in a state where it is still considered to be illegal but I use cannabis to treat a medical issue that I‰Ûªve had my whole life (not going into details because it‰Ûªs off topic for now). The war on drugs should have taught us all the lesson that just banning something or making it illegal doesn‰Ûªt solve a complex problem. Gun violence happens to be a very complex problem. For example 2/3 of all gun deaths are suicides. Mass shootings only make up .1 precent of total gun deaths and .3 precent of all gun related homicides. 13-14% of gun deaths are related to gang violence (check out Chicago which happens to have some of the most strict gun laws in the country). It‰Ûªs also important to note that violent crime overall has been steadily dropping for some time now and poverty has actually shown to be a bigger factor in violent crime than gun ownership. I‰Ûªm not saying I have the answers because I do not have the answers. BUT I‰Ûªm also not naive enough to assume that just banning something will actually solve a problem that is extremely complex. ,R

"> Other nations like Switzerland have that ability without the level of violence and number of school shootings the states has.The only reason Switzerland has a ""high"" gun ownership rate is that they require their citizens to train for their military much like the militia clause intended for the US. Even so comparing the two countries is not really fair: the rate of ownership is a quarter of that in the US. Also the gun laws are much stricter there. Guns have storage requirements there's no concealed carry and all firearms (and ammo!) are registered in a national registry for instance. >The bare fact of gun ownership is not the problem and indeed it's good that citizens can arm themselves. Switzerland has higher gun deaths than neighboring countries with stricter laws so your statement about gun ownership and gun violence is not borne out by the facts.

Yep over on r/news the highest upvoted comments on the counter march by some kids are all stuff like 'glad to see support for the second amendment' and 'standing up for the bill of rights' as if ANY gun regulation is against the constitution which is CLEARLY NOT the case since I can't go to the local car dealership and also buy a mobile artillery unit or walk into Walmart and pick up a stinger missile. But you don;t hear them screaming that the inability to buy those are 'destroying our constitution' because they know their own arguments are bullshit. Sadly though this bullshit actually works. It's time rational people take back the narrative and call this bullshit out. ,L
"This wouldn't have even been a debate 30 years ago. The NRA made a concerted effort in the 90s to turn the Second Amendment into something it isn't. They created this whole mythology of its supposedly inviolable nature axed the preamble and shut down any further discussion by screaming ""Shall not be infringed! Shall not be infringed!"" For the vast majorit of the Second Amendment's life we've had no problem ""infringing"" it. When we say that domestic abuse felons can't buy a machine gun that's an infringement. Does the NRA want to reverse every single gun regulation? No they know it would never fly with the public. So given that regulations already exist and we're mostly cool with them whence cometh this idea that it cannot be regulated?",L
"Define ""close""A cheaper than usual NFA tax stamp for modern sporting rifles?Psychological evaluation required for a licence to own a semi auto firearm?Oh how about we take the europe approach and say you have to be participating and active member of a shooting club to own advanced weapons? No enthusiast gets to just squirrel away with his arsenal on his own little lonesome.Or we can just apply fixes to all firearms so it doesn't feel like anyone is being singled out but personally I prefer the incremental approach easier to hit the breaks back up a little and try something else when something doesn't work as intended.",L
The kind of gun control that could actually make a dent in real-world gun violence is something pro 2A people would never ever support. Then again if we can't pass even small tiny things like raising the age limit on gun purchases to 21 then there's no way we'll get effective gun control passed. One good argument btw for the 21 year age limit is to give agencies more time to develop cases against young people who may be a danger to others. (However we'd also need a gun purchase restraining order act to go along with it -- right now the best law enforcement can do is involuntarily commit people or charge them with a crime.),L
What if my opinion on reasonable control doesn‰Ûªt involve banning any firearms? What if I want to focus on things like fixing our background check system and allowing individuals to run them for private sales? These are the systems that failed to keep guns out of the wrong hands not the fact that they‰Ûªre available. I‰Ûªd also love to see the NFA repealed in full. It exists solely to catch otherwise law abiding citizens off guard when they don‰Ûªt know every single law involving guns. It provides no increase in safety and doesn‰Ûªt keep criminals from making those devices anyway (SBRs suppressors machine guns).The problem gun owners have with anti-gun advocates is the language being used. There‰Ûªs some pretty hateful and ignorant (and sometimes violent) comments coming from that side of the argument. As a gun owner it‰Ûªs very hard to take your opinion seriously when you don‰Ûªt understand how the laws work you use skewed data to make your point and you call anyone with an AR a murderer.The other main issue I have with this gun debate is how underrepresented the pro-gun opinions are. They say ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs time for that conversation!‰Û but they‰Ûªre only interested in keeping their head in the echo chamber. It‰Ûªs not a conversation if you don‰Ûªt involve the people who will be most affected by gun control. Not a sign of good faith at all. ,L
To the second point the logistics of arming all teachers would be a nightmare. For the first point not all teachers might have a temperament for actually having a firearm on the premises (we've all had those crazy teachers who were a bit off). That and some areas it would be foolhardy to put guns where children could access them. Hell some police officers lose their own weapons at times (and a lot of police departments actually have accounted losing their own guns.)From a financial aspect that'd require the teachers to have hours and hours of fire arm training (the only way I could actually see this happening) and district issued fire arms bullets retraining etc and that would cost school districts that already are struggling with budget more money then they could afford. From a standpoint in case of an active shooter there is too big a risk of cross fire hitting students and AR's or other high capacity weapons would still rip through revolver-style firearms easily. Not to mention that responding officers won't have photographic memory of who is a staff member and who is a student and when it's a student shooting it's too easy for them to blend into the crowd to get an accurate shot (the Parkland shooter managed to leave campus this way by blending in with other students.)It's a good idea in practice and could work for armed security guards in school but arming all teachers would be a general nightmare to actually implement.,L
"Your talking point is ten years out-dated.  The Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the 2nd Amendment protects the individual right to own a firearm and isn't restricted to militias.  See: District of Columbia v. Heller.""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state"" is a preamble declaration that does not grant any rights to anyone.The second half of the 2nd Amendment is what matters.  It clearly states ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""  This directly grants individual gun rights.  It does not say ""the right of the militia to keep and bear arms.""Also keep in mind that the people behind our Constitution won a war against a tyrannical government that wanted to take their firearms.  They did not write the 2nd Amendment to become the government they just fought.  The main pillar of our Constitution is individual freedom and liberty.  There are no rights granted to collective entities such as militias in the Bill of Rights.  It's all about the individual.  ",R
I think what the author is getting at is private party transactions don't have a mechanism right now (or a requirement in most states) to ascertain the legal status of the purchaser.  So there are two parts to this:  1 - Provide a system that allows a private party seller to do a background check on a potential buyer.2 - require use of said system for all firearm transactions.  I don't think it's a bad idea at all actually.  I just want to ensure that it focuses on the person not to specific firearm.  e.g. I don't support gun registration but I do support requiring a background check even for private party transactions.,L
Don‰Ûªt point to ‰ÛÏyelling fire in a crowded theater‰Û when you‰Ûªre defending restricting constitutional rights. The court case that coined that expression was an example of the federal government with the help of the Supreme Court silencing a man voicing his conscience against a military draft for WWI.  The rationale being that him being allowed to agitate public dissatisfaction with such a measure presented such a danger to the country that stripping him of his 1st Amendment right was the only reasonable course of action. Funny thing when you ask the government whether it should be allowed to make laws on a subject the majority of the time it will say yes of course it‰Ûªs only common sense. Personally I‰Ûªd rather see any amount of libel slander or incitement than have even one person punished for voicing their conscience. Same for the rest of the bill of rights always best to err on the side of too much liberty than chance any form of infringement. ,L
But can we agree on what is reasonable?**EDIT** Because if you want to ban magazines over 10-rounds. I think that's unreasonable.I have 9 magazines for 3 different guns which are all above 10-rounds from the factory. One of my guns is no longer made and neither are magazines. That's an outright ban against that firearm. The others I would have to buy 13 new magazines at a price of approximately $45 apiece at a total cost of $585 to bring them into compliance. All the while not being compensated for the 5 magazines I would have to either destroy or surrender.,R

Las Vegas shooter was a 60+ year old with a huge stock pile of guns. He had a wife and a social life from what has been reported. I'd like to see what you say the people around him could have done to prevent that. Furthermore the super rare person is not so rare where then are literal gun shows where people can just go up buy a gun and walk out without any problem. That and private sales between two people do not require any background check in many states. And you say that no gun laws would prevent a shooting? How about one where it keeps track if you buy a lot of guns/ ammo in one time (say you buy 12 guns in a 4 month period or another double digit number) so that they can keep track of the person in case they try anything or if their stockpiling a lot. Registration laws would help law enforcement find guns that have travelled between states and identify if a gun is used in multiple areas (say a guy kills someone in wyoming moves to oklahoma without ever getting caught and kills someoen again. If there is a registry for guns then they can tie the two killings together). Generally stuff that would make law enforcement's lives much easier.,L
We've regulated almost all modern arms. You can't walk into walmart and buy tank shells.  Can't buy ballistic missiles. Or tomahawk cruise missiles. Or RPGs. Grenades? Nope. Mines? Well those were understandably banned by treaty... Automatic weapons? Negative on that too. Admittedly with sufficient licensing you or your business can build or buy most of these things (yay capitalism). But it's a lot of licensing prostate exam level licensing. The kind of licensing even democrats might say is too much licensing.Realistically we can buy some restricted small arms. The 2nd actually has quite a few restrictions between the NFA GCA and FOPA. I'm going to stand my ground at oddly-restricted-based-on-stock-configuration-and-barrel-length semi-automatic small arms.,R
"> hand guns which the ‰ÛÏassault weapons ban‰Û wouldn‰Ûªt stop. The ""ha ha"" funny thing about this line of thought which really isn't ha ha funny at all is when someone says ""an assault weapon was used in these school shootings"" people come out of the woodwork to say how it wasn't an assault weapon because assault weapon is a specific legal term and those weapons are de facto banned. And you know what? Those pedantic people are right. Columbine happened during the assault weapon ban but they didn't sue assault weapons thus the ban was effective no?Basically the assault weapons machine guns and explosives have been de facto banned via various pieces of legislation notably the NFA and Gun Control Act of 1968. So it raises the question of what if we made laws that were more in line with the NFA and GCA of 1698 for the rest of firearms? I mean if assault weapons haven't really been used in mass shootings or crimes (other than direct violation of the NFA and GCA such as not having a proper tax stamp not having proper paperwork for transportation across state lines etc. Bascially non-aggressive crimes) as is always pointed out why wouldn't it work this way?Sure there's a lot of firearms already out there and you are not going to stop every criminal act with a law but if you can reduce the amount of incidents down by 10% is that not worth it? But it seems it's always a run around in response. Political suicide is the main argument against it but that's not a really good argument for why something like the NFA and GCA which have been tested in the courts wouldn't work if expanded.",R
"the current problem that the focus is placed too at this time is protecting school children from these horrible massacres.  there appears to be a simple solution to that particular problem and that would be to immediately require 2 police offices (sheriffs etc) to be on all public school grounds every school day during typical school hours.  congress could simply pass a bill to help pay for the on call officers and the local police could determine the best practices to deploy the school stationed officers that would provide the most safety for the students.  simple.  ok so the likely counter arguments would likely include ""police departments lack resources to provide this school safety net"".  and that goes to the cannabis topic as we can redirect so called drug resources to school safety issue and I truly believe we would get about 70 to 80% agreement with the American public to make this simple resource change and thus we have freed up a couple of officers to be stationed at each school and the children would be safe and the gun laws remain unchanged.

"I completely agree it's a very unfair comparison in my opinion. The weight of most weapons and their bulk makes it a hell of a lot harder to secretly transport them over drugs. As an example one kilogram of heroin is a thousand grams. This is then cut once it makes it to the US so let's say 2000 grams before it hits the consumer. Your average addict is most likely doing less than a gram a day so that kilo of heroin snuck over the border in baggies in someone's asshole will provide at least 2000 doses. This isn't even mentioning fentanyl which is so widely used now because it is much stronger and so more ""bang"" is snuck in in a smaller package. One AR-15 weighs around 3 kilograms and there's no way it's getting into the country in little bags in someone's asshole.

Upvoting because I agree with you.  But I also agree with Aneeta96.Democrats have indeed proposed modest gun controls but too often those are proposed in the midst of debates where more extreme measures are getting the attention.  Or they are proposed alongside more extreme measure.  As an example even David Hogg will say that he doesn't want to take anybody's guns away.  He has very reasonable positions.  At the same time the right is hearing a former Supreme Court Justice say the 2nd Amendment should be repealed.I honestly don't know what the answer is.  If it were possible for the debate to cool down maybe time could make a reasonable conversation possible.  But mass shootings are happening often enough that the issue is urgent and won't cool down.The things Aneeta proposes are good steps and I wish they would be proposed along with very public statements about *not* being about confiscating or banning certain guns.We need the centrists to take this and make it happen.,L

Handguns are responsible for more mass shootings and gun deaths overall than rifles of all types; it wouldn't be logically consistent to ban one and not the other if your concern is saving lives.

But yelling 'fire' doesn't necessarily incite imminent lawless action. It could cause a panic for which you may be held responsible.    I asked this question the other day and I honestly still don't know the answer to it but I don't think it's as clear cut as most people make it out to be.",R
"When you talk about support for gun control what kind of gun control you support matters. Most people who talk about gun control tend to hedge things off a bit by saying they're still for the second.It's sort of like when people say ""no one is coming for your guns"" because technically they grandfather those guns or they leave a few. I've notice how a lot of people are now having to say ""no one is coming for all guns"" because they are coming for some. Those same people say they're for the second as well. It just doesn't feel genuine.",R
There is a big difference.  Actually several but I'll focus on three.1) Restrictions on the 1st amendment are very limited.  Very very limited.  Like VERY limited.  You can say pretty much anything any time to anyone.  It is extraordinarily rare that you cannot.2) Limits to the 2nd amendment effectively take away that right.  Why should someone be able to join the military at 18 but not purchase a rifle?  It makes no sense.  Honestly its the same thing with alcohol.  Why do you have to wait until 21?  What is so magical about 21?  If you can't purchase a gun until 21 then you don't have the right.  According to the 25th amendment you reach the age of majority (ie. adulthood) at 18.  So how is it you don't have one of the constitutionally guaranteed rights until your 21?  That's not how rights work.  Rights are rights you don't have to get permission from the government to exercise them - that is the whole point.3) We have lots of limitations on the 2nd amendment already.  We cannot stop all crazy people from doing crazy things.  Putting more and more rules in place that impact law abiding citizens does not stop crazy.  Background checks don't either.  Do you know the Parkland shooter purchased his rifle legally using a background check?  None of the new pushed laws for gun control after this latest incident would have stopped him.  ,R
I don't which is why I support changing the way we deal with mental illness in order to encourage people to seek help.Removing guns from the equation doesn't make us any healthier mentally. It could have some damage mitigation effects but so long as any gun can be purchased there will be suicides by gun.A waiting period can help. I don't have a problem with my state law of a week waiting period between purchase and transfer of ownership. Forcing someone to think about it for a week gives them time to reconsider and get help.As for the problem with mass shootings that basically requires an essay. Fortunately I've written one before.I'm alright with red flag laws. Something like that would have prevented Dylan Roof from having a gun as his parents took his away. If there was legal force behind that and a safe place to store it like a police storage locker then he wouldn't have been able to go on his shooting. I do believe that the police should not be able to initiate the order on their own though. The cops being able to just decide someone's a danger and then go remove a constitutional right from them does not sit well and even the ACLU has come out against such a law in my state.Enforcing laws against straw purchasing can help with the proliferation of guns in general.Federal waiting periods on handgun purchases at least.I'm OK with universal background checks even though it was originally a compromise on the Brady Bill that private sales would not require a check. We have the technology now to open up the ability to run checks to everyone. Let me do it on my phone and even if such a system weren't mandatory I'd still use it.Aggressively enforce the existing law requiring anyone making more than X sales or more than Y percent of income to obtain an FFL so they have to run BCs on all purchases. The specific numbers can be debated. I'd say 5 firearms and 10% of income.The rest of the solutions are far more about the system we live in rather than directly about guns. I think it's safe to say we have more than a gun problem we have an aimless mass murder problem. Some shootings are politically motivated like Dylan Roof but others like in Vegas have no discernible political motive. While still horrific I at least understand terrorism. I think it's our society that treats people as inherently replaceable. If you don't do the job well enough we'll find someone who will. Very little in our society is invested in the individual particularly when that individual doesn't or struggles to fit in.To that end we need single payer health insurance including mental health services. We need to increase funding to schools and focus on anti-bullying initiatives that actually work rather than inane zero tolerance policies that punish kids for standing up for themselves. End the war on drugs end the war on terror. We can't claim violence is wrong when we perpetuate it against poor communities here and other peoples abroad.,R
"**What are semi-automatic weapons?** Semi-automatic weapons are firearms that fire per each operation of the trigger. Every pull will fire another shot. Semi-automatic rifles are quite possibly the most popular firearms for sport and are used in the millions every day. Popular semi-auto rifles can be had for as low as a few hundred dollars these days such as the SKS AR-15 or the Remington Model 8 (from the early 1900s).**Why is this unreasonable?**Semi-automatic weapons are used in almost no crimes statisticly represent a minute fraction.https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/wuvc01.pdfRegard this study which has a section outlining violent crime in the US including some of the most violent years in modern record (the 90s) and data in the early parts of the Assault Weapons Ban.You can see that even here the vast majority of crimes are done by handguns (700000) versus ""other gun[s]"" (100000). This is tiny especially noting that shotguns and rifles are two different classes in regards to those crimes.This is also ignoring the argument for the 2nd amendment which is seen as a pretty clear amendment these days. I'd be happy to provide information on that if curious.The truth is that gun crime is falling regardless of the laws these weapons are not the problem and all studies show that poverty is the number one determinate for violent crime. This is something that neither party (thought the democrats do focus more on it) addresses well.We've come to a point where we are attempting to treat a cold with good smelling candles rather than medicine. Banning guns or restricting semi-autos or features thereof won't fix crime only furthering our efforts to bring forth social betterment and mutual aide will.",R
Then voting rights should be 21.  Ability to enter contracts 21.  Join the military 21.  If you are an adult at 18 then you are an adult.  If there are things people can't do until 21 then they should change the age of adult responsibility for everything to 21.As to the effective gun control without other social programs in place no form of gun control will ever work.  All of the countries people like to brag about all have social programs that done at more good than their gun laws.  Granted some of those countries are now arresting people for being mean in Facebook so there is something wrong there as well.,R
That indicates that all people who own AR-15s or the like are child murderers btw if you didn't intend to say that.While I agree there are highly niche reasons for one to buy an AR-15 one of them probably being display I disagree we need to ban all assault weapons.What we do need to do is regulate gun control. Everyone who buys a gun needs to register for an ID that tells those around them who they are and what gun(s) they own and have a license to use. Every single gun owner needs to pass a test that ensures they understand how to clean fire and carry/store that gun both alone and with other people and that test should include ID and background checks every time. This check should also be YEARLY to ensure that this person is still mentally and physically responsible enough to carry store and behave with that gun around others. If said gun is a highly effective weapon(AR-15 and up) it should have regulation checks more often to ensure that the user is still the same person who passed the background checks for the gun. Gun control should be at least as regulated as driving a car. I agree that taking away guns and gun attachments is a slippery slope but I do agree dammit that we need to properly regulate guns so that responsible people own them and most importantly keep regulating them as long as that person owns them.,L
"An independent committee of firearm experts legal experts and academics/researchers under the supervision of a non-partisan and reputable think tank.I don't trust politicians to define reasonable. Democrats want to ban aesthetical components and Republicans want machine guns(generalized but the sentiment is there).EDIT: And just to clarify here since some people seem to have a flawed notion of what a ""firearm expert"" is there are many experts on firearms that don't have financial interests in firearm sales. Military quartermasters don't work for gun manufactuers or the NRA. Drill instructors don't work for gun manufacturers(though a lot will be NRA certified since the NRA is pretty much the one recognized for it so you more or less don't have any choice unless you're military or law enforcement). Gunsmiths don't have to work for gun manfacuters or affiliate with the NRA(just as somebody can be a mechanic and not be a Ford employee or shareholder).There's a toxic narrative revolving around the 2A and firearms that creates an absurd degree of ignorance on both sides of the aisle. The rest of us in the middle are sick of this bullshit and would rather have actual experts work on the issue without interference from special interests corporate lobbies and political factions(which is certanly possible for you naysayers who seem to assume such a committee would be impossible. There are still responsible and mature *adults* who can work on such topics without devolving into shit flinging childish primitives).",L
"A reasonable solution addresses the problem without inherent bias or discrimination and leaves both sides of the issues agreeable to a proposed solution. There has to be give and take compromise and a willingness to cooperate in good faith. Those who shout irresponsibly about ""taking my guns away"" and the others who clamor about a full repeal of the 2nd amendment need to stay out of the conversation. We need a moderating temperment that addresses legitimate concerns on both sides.As a liberal gun owner I own a lot of firearms/ammunition and realize that our country has an ongoing gun violence problem and we need to have a constructive conversation now and not later. ",L
"> What if my opinion on reasonable control doesn‰Ûªt involve banning any firearms?You are free to express and advocate for your opinion. But in a democracy you need to accept that you may be over ruled. > The other main issue I have with this gun debate is how underrepresented the pro-gun opinions are.I call BS on this line of argument - I have tried very hard to engage with pro-gun people no. I am pro gun. I've tried very hard to engage in little to no-regulations for gun people. They refuses because they know when conversation happen anyway they can say ""but we weren't involved"".These conversations are happening and pro-gun people are welcome to speak up about reasonable and that includes being meaningful enough to be reasonable to others. And if they don't want to then they don't have to. But they no longer get to complain that there weren't part of a solution because they didn't get it the way they wanted. ",L
"A serious national conversation or debate on reasonable changes to gun control has never been initiated to date. Both sides offer their respective rhetoric on the subject but our legislators in office will not engage in meaningful discussion. When many legislators are receiving millions of dollars in campaign donations from gun rights organizations it gives the impression that they will only ""toe the line"" of that group. A dialogue about meaningful gun reform needs to happen irregardless of who is being influenced by what group. If everyone can come to the table with the acknowlegement that our country is in the grips of a gun violence problem only then can we proceed. Increasingly the sentiment is that the status quo on gun deaths is no longer tolerable.The young people led by the Parkland survivors are not calling for repeal of the 2nd amendment. They want to establish a national conversation that addresses gun control responsibly and fairly. Many of these students have parents who are gun owners in fact.",L
Well I'll counter that with saying that pro-gun folks have had since the 1990s to produce the legislation that would work but instead have focused on forcing guns more and more into places in society where they aren't wanted or needed. Pushing CCW and reciprocity isn't a way to make for good relations with the growing majority of Americans that don't own guns or see any need to do so.I agree with your initial statement regarding the NFA and all the other laws surrounding 'cosmetic' stuff like the 1994 AWB. At the same time if we as gun owners were willing to agree to stuff like getting rid of private sales and licensing with on-going re-licensing to ensure that the gun owners were keeping their noses clean and their weapons stored safely we would probably have reduced the number of gun crimes especially the extravagant ones like the mass shootings that have become so common in the past few decades. I doubt that we can eliminate gun crimes or violence but personally I think that the pro-gun folks need to step up and take the lead. Otherwise the rest of society will step in and the results will be a draconian set of restrictions.,R
"Thousands of people going to a rally means nothing.  NRA donations also increased by millions.  Dems are down [to a 6 point lead](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/379561-dems-lead-by-6-on-generic-house-ballot-poll) in a generic ballot down from [16 points](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/375625-poll-dems-lead-by-16-points-on-generic-ballot) at the time of the shooting.  Because of the demographics of the country (rural areas are more red and more of the country is rural) Dems need at least a 6-point lead to win.  They had a shot at taking back the Senate and honestly just lost it.  If they keep on about guns they might lose their shot at the House too.  The majority of America doesn't want to vote for politicians who are fucking with the Bill of Rights.  This is the hill the ""blue wave"" dies on.",L
"Awesome! No weapons for women and all guys over 45 need to turn in their weapons!!! Checkmate old fogies.There is no way to honestly reconcile ""individual"" with ""well(-)regulated militia"". A militia is an organized group and your own sources say that they must be well-trained.Same guy writing here:https://pundithouse.com/2013/01/an-open-letter-to-piers-morgan/The first purpose of the militia is to come to the assistance of the state if it needs it because it's supposed to be well-trained. That is most definitely not the case with individual owning weapons. The guy defines ""well(-) regulated"" as ""[in] proper working order... calibrated correctly functioning as expected"". You have to be dishonest to pretend any of those things means ""individual"".Also the Declaration of Independence starts with this:> We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.There were 11000 homicides with firearms in 2016. What happened to the unalienable rights of those people to life?> That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed Most of the governed want assaults rifles banned yet here we are. Also why can you bring guns to many places but not to the Supreme Court? Because ""conservatives"" are liars and hypocrites.",R
With the Parkland shooter [school and county officials requested that he be involuntary committed under the Baker Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/nikolas-cruz-baker-act.html) which has been law since 1971.  If they had actually followed through with this back in 2016 instead of doing nothing this information would have been entered into the FBI background database and he wouldn't have been able to pass a federal NICS background check.He was also investigated for making terroristic threats a couple of times of which a conviction would have prevented him from purchasing a firearm.  He also committed assault a couple of times and attempted suicide.  There were multiple occasions where school officials Broward County deputies county officials and his adopted parents had an opportunity to get him into the system in such a way that he wouldn't have been able to legally purchase firearms.  Nobody followed through or stepped up.While I fully agree that there are issues with the background check system as evidenced by the Sutherland Springs killer the Parkland shooting was not a failure of the background check system.  It was a failure of the **entire** system at every single level.,L
"> Pro gunners love that the parkland shooter attained his weapon because of an LEO fuckupNo we don't. It would better if he never heard the word ""gun"" much less had one. My question is if the current system should have caught the last shooter and failed why is expanding that system to additional transactions going to be an improvement?> what about all the other shootings we've had where that isn't relevant?They passed background checks for the most part. Almost all of them had nothing in their background that would have failed them. The notable exceptions are Columbine shooters (straw purchase) the less deadly shooting last year that was done with an 80% lower AR and Sandy Hook (murdered his mother).",L
Yeah I don't think anyone is suggesting arming *all* teachers.Generally the suggestions are something along the lines of a couple per school to add the element of never knowing which teacher is armed or where they might be coming from. Since the average school shooting is ending before the average police response time to those shootings it's usually being confronted by the armed resource officer or the shooter committing suicide that is ending these events. Financially a gun and some training is probably a few grand per teacher. You could get a whole army for the price of a single overpaid bureaucrat and dozens of those for every full time cop on site. As to crossfire risk...we're talking about a fraction of a fraction. The body counts are high because the shooters are meeting no resistance. As soon as they meet resistance the killing stops or slows rapidly. As tragic as someone dying in a crossfire might be...statistically it's a lower risk than waiting for a cop to show up. It's one of those no win situations where you have to be willing to risk 1 to save 10 or 20. In a confined environment like a school there advantage actually goes to a handgun over a rifle unless the attacker actually has body armor which isn't that common. More school attackers are actually armed with handguns than rifles. ,R
I kind of think the opposite. For decades gun safety advocates have pushed small ball issues that poll super well with voters - common sense things like closing the gun show loophole or banning bump stocks. Those ideas are fine and make sense but won't  fundamentally address the underlying problem - that Americans are killed by firearms at by far the highest rate in the developed world. To actually deal w the problem you need more radical and less popular solutions. And the NRA and its allies have attacked anyone who wants any restrictions on anything as anti-2a so why not opt for genuinely radical moves. ,L
Murder aggravated assault armed robbery are all crimes irrespective of the weapon and exist in countries even with strong weapon control laws.There are databases of reports of individuals and groups who threaten the peace. Sometimes those databases have peaceful groups in them but the existence of those databases is not a secret. We accept them in general as a cost of living in a civil society.While there are no background checks to practice a religion we do rightly keep an eye on practitioners of some fringe religions (Santeria and some Native American religions come to mind). If the religion could pose a public threat we do keep an eye on them.There may not be a particular list of words that can not be said in public but there are general laws against inciting violence riots or public threats. If you go into public with the intent to intimidate or threaten people you are going to be shut down by the police. And there are still the 7 words you can not say on TV (somewhat relaxed these days due to most TV being cable/internet oriented and not tied to the public airwaves).,L
">the reason we have access to guns is to keep the government in checkFunny that there are literally hundreds of countries around the world with far fewer guns per capita than the US and are *not* dictatorships.Moreover the 2nd Amendment says nothing about *why* it exists. It doesn't specifically state that it is to ""shoot back at the government"".In addition the US Army is on the whole a profoundly conservative insititution. I sincerely doubt they would comply with a President's order to impliment a total dictatorship.Also I find that most of the people who crow the loudest about the 2A being to prevent a dictatorship are the same people that say that they would be comfortable with Trump calling off all elections and being President-for-Life so it's a little hard for me to take that argument seriously.And I didn't say the AR-15 is incapable of home defense I just cast doubt that a situation to warrant its use can't be that frequent.",L
"> Totally. Well if you don‰Ûªt know a sentence works. Stop. You are applying modern grammatical rules to a document written 200+ years ago. Based on the grammar rules of the time as well as a large amount of commentary by the founding fathers it is painfully obvious that the 2nd was only ever intended to apply to militias and people within them.>Assuming you mean guns like the AR-15 they‰Ûªre simply the best tools for the job. His point was that you don't need a tool of that caliber to defend yourself.

> I don't think it's up to you to decide what is proper for a person to defend their home.This sentence is rather amazing in how wrong it is on every facet.Nobody said he should be choosing who can do anything.Nobody said anything about defending homes.The 2nd amendment is SOLELY about defending the nation from external threats and toppling the government if needed. It says nothing about self defense hunting recreational use of guns or collecting guns.Nobody is saying that people with a legitimate fear of harm should not be given the tools appropriate to defend themselves.That last point being said the vast majority of people do not have a legitimate fear of harm that necessitates a gun for self fdefense.,R
"All semi rifles are not the same that is a stupid comment. And it isn't just the black painting having a rifle designed to accept modular attachments like forward grips flash suppressors and other shit like that is why people call it an assault rifle - it's designed to accept tactical attachments. I'm so tired of the fucking intellectually dishonest arguments. ""What is an assault rifle."" You were a kid once. You played Halo or counter strike or rainbow six. You could get sub machine guns assault rifles sniper rifles shot guns there was never any semantic debate over it if one kid said ""get the assault rifle"" you knew exactly what they meant.

"As others have mentioned your support of the 2A comes into question which is absolutely fine.

The NRA/gun enthusiasts spew cheap rhetoric that the problem needs to be solved but the thing is they view all solutions are ""taking their rights away"".So until the NRA and the gun crowd actually offer solutions they are nothing but bullshitters.And we also need to understand that the Vegas shooter was an upstanding well-to-do citizen and one day he just cracked.

The seller then submits the information to the FBI via a toll-free phone line or over the internet and the agency checks the applicant's info against databases.* **The process can take as little as a few minutes**"".And that's without adressing states that do not require checks on gun shows and private sales>and you have to pay the government on top of what you pay for the machine gun.

"If the 2nd Amendment only applies to people within the militia why does it make the distinction between ""a well-regulated militia"" and ""the people""? You are missing the critical point that the right of the people to keep and bear arms is explicitly stated separate from the militia. Also keep in mind the Bill of Rights enumerates the rights of the INDIVIDUAL. The Fourth protects the INDIVIDUAL from unreasonable searches and seizures the First protects the INDIVIDUAL's right to free speech. Why would all of the other rights apply to the individual but only the Second apply to the group. It is nonsensical.",R
Do you think the weapons talked about in these assault weapons ban don't fall under the Gun Control Act? NFA check isn't that much different than a normal background check everyone goes through when buying a gun from a shop. It is my understanding that it is a bit more involved but amounts to running info through a few more checks.The main problem I have with NFA is the extra fees involved way longer wait times and how easy some of the rules are to break compared to non-NFA items. If you go by newer federal assault weapons bill and make all that NFA items you might as well make any semi-auto firearm an NFA item. Keep in mind NFA includes grenades rockets and full-auto.,R
I'm all for increasing the age to 25 as there is this debate that children don't even become adults till 25.   Or even 21.  But if they can't own a gun as they are not of age then they should vote either or smoke  or drink or join the military as well.  It should be all or nothing in that sense.  If that makes sense.A lost of weapons are semi automatic.  Shotguns to pistols to rifles.  Bolt actions serve there purpose but so so semi.  Plus more younger shooters are into semi versus bolt.   Plus if someone wanted to hurt people they would still easily find a way even with a bolt.,R
Thousands and thousands of people have that stuff you've just never heard of it because no crime ever happens with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger [has a tank collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l61fEu4iIHI&t=1s) and if the guns on his don't work it's because he hasn't bothered to file the tax forms for them.

Here's a couple of examples.[Flak 88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_bGczFQIOc)[25 mm anti tank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7_Jttcv0WU)There are literally 100's of thousands of people who collect that stuff or go to shows to watch people drive it around or shoot it. You've just never seen it near you because it's probably against a whole bunch of real good zoning laws and noise ordinances.

Everything but RPGs are actually legal to own in the US. There are also historical references to personally owned battleships and cannons dating back to the revolutionary war.  I should also point out there were Semi-Automatic Rifles with a 15 round magazine used by Lewis and Clark (and the french army) as well. Most Gun Control that is discussed here is described as arbitrary because we often see politicians proposing new laws that are already on the books. Rather than pass ANOTHER law that makes it illegal to sell to someone convicted of domestic violence why not fight for FUNDING to enforce it? Or create new systems to make sure local and state convictions reach the national background check system more quickly?Another example when Obama proposed new rules for the ATF to ban gun trusts as a way to circumvent background checks (a good thing) what he didn't mention it was already going to be done without his guidance. You all are often so ignorant of gun laws that you will accept anything that is thrown to you without even thinking about it.,L

>A waiting period can help. I don't have a problem with my state law of a week waiting period between purchase and transfer of ownership. Forcing someone to think about it for a week gives them time to reconsider and get help.From what I've read suicide attempts are extremely impulsive events. By the time someone gets to a gun shop and purchases a firearm an attempt is extremely unlikely.Keeping a firearm in a safe with a 5 minute delay in opening would be far more effective than a 7 day waiting period to purchase a firearm. (not that I'm advocating for time delays just pointing out how impulsive suicide attempts are.),L
The problem with those things is that if you pay attention to the rhetoric they‰Ûªre just the next step towards gun bans and confiscation.

"I mean when you have many of the leaders of the gun control movement talking about how their goal is to ban guns calls to repeal the second amendment speakers at the March for Our Lives in DC saying [‰ÛÏWhen they give us that inch that bump stock ban we will take a mile!‰Û](https://twitter.com/joshdcaplan/status/977690909826535424) when previous compromise becomes today's ""loophole"" when the supposed paranoid concerns of gun-rights groups about previous measures become [reality in the US](https://i.imgur.com/1a62Ncb.jpg)...When prominent people on the other side publically say ""we've greased this slope its our goal for you to slide down to the bottom and if you don't on the first time will give you another push"" the slippery slope argument isn't wrong.Ask yourself what do the pro-gun people get out of ""compromising""?  They don't get any regulation lifted even when the evidence is clear that said regulations don't work.  They don't get any reliable assurance that the rest of their rights will be secure after the ""compromise"" (in fact virtually every piece of evidence available shows it won't).  They only get to keep some of their rights for now.[This](https://i.imgur.com/TO8BGgw.png) is pretty much what happens except the cake thief is sometimes literally telling you they'll be coming back for more soon. ",R
Help what issue exactly? The slippery slope argument is not as batshit as people make it out to be. We know banning certain guns isn‰Ûªt going to put a stop to mass shootings so if we do ban all AR-15s and impose magazine limits and ammo bans what do we do when the next shooting *inevitably* happens? What‰Ûªs banned next? Violent crime has been dropping every year for decades including deaths from mass shootings. 2017 was one of the lowest in a long time. We should be focusing on passing legislation based on facts and the fact is the AR-15 being widely available does nothing to increase gun crime. If the Virginia tech shooter with a .22 and 9mm (both with reduced capacity mags) can kill twice as many people as shootings with ARs what‰Ûªs a ban going to do?The truth is many of these mass shootings happened because *somebody fucked up* and didn‰Ûªt do their job. I‰Ûªm looking at the school system law enforcement the military all these agencies failed to report fucked up individuals to the ATF/FBI and they weren‰Ûªt put on a prohibited list. Nick Cruz brought a machete to school and nobody cared literally nobody. Why add more laws when you don‰Ûªt even enforce the ones we have on the books and can ACTUALLY SAVE LIVES unlike banning the sale of certain firearms. Using emotional arguments in lieu of fact based research is going to get more people killed.,R
"California made a 'reasonable' attempt at gun control that was supposed to protect the people that purchased handguns. They required that all new handguns sold by an FFL or transferred in from out of state through an FFL had to meet certain safety requirements. At the start this was accomplished by testing the firearm for a few hundred rounds and doing drop testing on each one. Now to be added to the roster any new handgun model must imprint a microscopic serial number onto every fired case in multiple locations. Unfortunately this technology doesn't exist so California's roster of handguns approved for sale shrinks every year. Soon the number of handguns available will be in the single digits or lower all in the name of ""safety"". ",R
more to the fact that we're sick of this anti-gun bullshit especially when it isn't based upon any sort of valid research.  you have people arguing for the banning of assault weapons (or semi auto rifles) while disregarding handguns which in reality account for the vast vast majority of gun crime / homicides.Or how about not lumping suicides in with gun homicides?  I'm about as leftist as you can get (left of bernie sanders unsure whether you'd call me a marxist or a socialist probably more marx since i'm into dialect(s)(al) explanations of things / historical materialism etc.  And I'm for having a second amendment.The DNC can suck a dick; i'm so disgusted with 'em i may in fact vote for trump next pres. election.  (why? read thomas frank's listen liberal - the dnc has said a rather large fuck you to the working classes/midwest entirely),L
"If you want to analyze a document written in that age you do it using the definitions of the words at the time not the modern ones.Not sure where you're going with the well trained part I consider myself well trained and I've never taken a official course.As to ""individual"" take a look at the amendment.A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State *the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.*Here's a cute video explaining it.https://youtu.be/P4zE0K22zH8https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._HellerSupreme Court of the United StatesåÊheld that theåÊSecond AmendmentåÊprotects an individual'såÊrightåÊto possess aåÊfirearm unconnected with service in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes.https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082See the Declaration of Independence isnt a legal document the Consititution and and Bill of Rights are. I feel cheeky so ill say that all men being created equal goes hand in hand with firearms as they are known as the great equalizer :D.Considering homicides have been dropping since the early 90s and gun ownership has been rising it hard to correlate the two. Not to mention that there are 300 million reported firearms in the US 11000 is pretty small.Also considering that the majority of gun crime is committed with illegally obtained pistols in cities by black males against other black males.

"> ""but muh freedoms!""> > Get over itThat right there is why Republicans who support nothing positive get people to the polls. > society's mind is changing on thisLess than you think. > We are realizing that 'guns for almost everyone' is a net loss for society. They say a Republican is just a Democrat who's gotten mugged. After Sandy Hook we saw the same numbers in the Polls. Four years later we elected the least competent President much less Republican in living memory and one who ran on among other things the rallying cry of ""our beautiful Second Amendment"". Even if public opinion changes the courts don't very often and even if President Trump is impeached and removed from office they're only going to get more conservative for the next 2.5 years if they change at all. We're not going to repeal the 2nd in our lifetimes I'm all but certain. When I was those kids age I thought some more ""common sense gun laws"" would be a good idea too. Now that I'm older I recognize them to be the least effective way to secure our kids and build a less violent future. I doubt I'm unique.",L
">  To start stop selling themSetting aside the fact you'd 1st have to repeal 2A (which ain't gonna happen) ... the idea of ""stop selling"" them really doesn't apply to something an end-user can freely make. (most home-users cannot freely make an incandescent light bulb. But with something like a Ghost Gunner 3D CNC machine (available on Amazon for a reasonably low $1700).. pretty much anyone can buy an 80% lower and turn it into a Rifle in a couple hours. You can't really stop millions of people from doing that. > ""Confiscate and press charges if discovered by warrant lawful stop etc...""There's an estimated 160million gun owners in the USA currently... you'd have to turn the USA into a Police-state to achieve what you're describing. ",R
Gun-ownership in America is currently estimated at 42% (roughly) of the overall population of 325 million. Thats (again roughly) 162million people who have guns. There's really no effective or logistically workable solution to enforce that. (unless you want to hire enough ATF agents to turn the USA into a Police-state ?... ) A gun in a case/box.. could probably be transferred between 100's of people before anyone could logistically stop that. Now multiple that by 300 to 400 million guns in this country. I mean... you can currently buy 3D machines like the Ghost Gunner  on Amazon.com for around $1700 .... The situation with guns today.. is much like the situation with file-trading in the 90's and early 2000's (MP3's bit-torrent etc). It's a game of whack-a-mole. and I wouldn't bet any money on the powers of authority winning. ,R

I hope you see my point on the 3rd. > If you go into public with the intent to intimidate or threaten people you are going to be shut down by the police.Under trespassing laws. > And there are still the 7 words you can not say on TV...I hear those words on TV all the time just not on the frequencies regulated by the US Government through the FCC. They're not relaxed they're only prohibited under certain conditions. There are even obscenity laws for shouting them in public. There is no prohibition however in me shouting at the top of my lungs in my living room. I could not be reported save for noise ordinances.,R
">but the point is that gun owners who understand gun policy need to propose solutions to the problem beyond ""thoughts and prayers""It's not like they don't. You don't think Democratic politicians aren't side-lining what they'd consider an electoral minority? Gun owners are basically stuck between Democrats who want to ban aesthetical/functional parts of guns to make gun ownership impossible/impractical and Republicans with their crazyass NRA lobbying support. The narrative of the 2A being a right-wing/Republican thing is stronger in the public conscious than the 2A being an overall American right in the US Constitution. I mean there are people who think the 2A is outdated and should be gotten rid of all together and I personally find that pretty fucking disturbing(and I say this for the entire Bill of Rights. It was hard enough to get said rights down I'm not comfortable with the notion of setting a precedence of functionally killing rights through draconian legislation)",R
